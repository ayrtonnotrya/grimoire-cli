  "central_thesis": "This research posits that individuals who have never formed close personal relationships ('non-close-relaters') are less likely to believe in or experience paranormal phenomena ('goats'), in contrast to 'close-relaters' ('sheep'). The paper explores various psychological and parapsychological hypotheses for this discrepancy, ultimately suggesting that paranormal abilities operate bidirectionally—as 'hitting' (facilitating desired outcomes like relationship formation) or 'missing' (unintentionally hindering intimacy and causing adverse outcomes), with 'missing' often going unrecognized as a psi phenomenon in everyday life.",

      "chapter_title": "Part 1: The Relationship between Closeness and Paranormal Experience",
      "summary": "This section introduces the concept of 'non-close-relaters'—individuals who report never having formed a deep, reciprocated personal relationship. Empirical studies are presented, showing that these individuals tend to be more shy, introverted, mistrustful, and socially inept. Crucially, non-close-relaters consistently report lower belief in ESP and fewer personal paranormal experiences, identifying them as 'goats' in parapsychological terms, unlike 'close-relaters' who are 'sheep'. The author then proposes five hypotheses to explain this observed difference, moving from purely psychological explanations to increasingly parapsychological ones."

      "chapter_title": "Some Hypotheses on Psi in Relationships",
      "summary": "Thalbourne outlines five potential explanations for the observed link between relationship status and psi experience: (1) Misinterpretation of coincidences as telepathy within close relationships. (2) Non-close-relaters' negative attitudes towards interpersonal communication extending to psi. (3) The 'closeness hypothesis,' where close relationships directly facilitate telepathy. (4) The 'rapport hypothesis,' suggesting inherent telepathic ability fosters close relationships, which non-close-relaters may lack. (5) The central 'psi-missing hypothesis,' proposing that non-close-relaters utilize their psi ability to 'miss' (generate counter-intentional outcomes or reduce intimacy), while close-relaters 'hit' (facilitate desired outcomes). This 'missing' is often subliminal and unrecognized as ESP."

      "chapter_title": "Part 2: Case Study of a 'Paranormal Misser'",
      "summary": "To illustrate the concept of 'paranormal missing,' the paper presents a case study of H.W.J. Edwards, who describes a lifelong pattern of 'bad luck,' losing objects, misinterpreting directions to his detriment, causing accidents, and generally experiencing outcomes contrary to his conscious intent. These incidents, such as his 'Jonah' effect on sports teams or his luggage consistently getting lost, are interpreted by the author as spontaneous, pervasive instances of 'negative ESP' or 'psi-missing' in everyday life, significantly impacting his personal efficacy and potentially his relationships."

In interpersonal contexts, this can lead to reduced intimacy, missed opportunities, or 'bad luck,' and is generally unrecognized by the individual as a paranormal phenomenon.

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "This paper is a research study and theoretical exploration rather than a practical magical manual. It does not present a codified 'system' of magic, rituals, or tools. Instead, it offers a conceptual framework for understanding how inherent paranormal abilities, whether conscious or unconscious, might operate to either facilitate ('hitting') or hinder ('missing') the formation of relationships and other life outcomes. The insights derived, however, are invaluable for a magician in understanding the subtle, often unrecognized, influences of their own 'psi' or unconscious will on their life circumstances. It prompts a deeper self-inquiry into whether one's underlying personality and belief structures are configured for 'hitting' (success, connection) or 'missing' (self-sabotage, isolation).",

      "text": "Part 1. There exists a minority of individuals who report that they have never, in their lifetimes, formed an extremely close personal and emotional relationship with another human being. Psychological research indicates that, compared with persons who report that they have at some time entered into such a relationship, these “non-close-relaters” tend to be more shy, more lacking in trust, more introverted and more lacking in social skills. In addition, non-close-relaters are less likely to believe in ESP or to report personal experience of paranormal phenomena; that is, they are more often than not intellectual and experiential “goats”.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "While framed within parapsychology, this work offers profound insights for Occultism. The concept of 'paranormal hitting' directly parallels successful magical manifestation, where intent (conscious or unconscious) aligns with external outcomes, facilitating desired relationships or situations. Conversely, 'paranormal missing' provides a theoretical framework for understanding self-sabotage, unintended negative consequences of magical workings, or persistent 'bad luck' often encountered by practitioners. From an occult perspective, a 'non-close-relater' or 'goat' might be viewed as an individual whose unconscious magical will (or 'current') consistently works against their conscious desires for connection, creating obstacles or attracting adverse synchronistic events. This aligns with Hermetic principles of 'as above, so below,' where internal states profoundly influence external reality, and Shadow Work in Chaos Magic, emphasizing the integration of unconscious drives that might subvert conscious intent. The research implicitly underscores the importance of self-awareness, clear intention, and psychological integration in effective magical practice, suggesting that personality traits and underlying attitudes can significantly modulate a practitioner's 'psi-hitting' or 'psi-missing' capacity.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience is academic parapsychologists, psychologists, and researchers in social psychology and interpersonal relationships. However, for an occultist, this paper is highly relevant to those exploring the psychological mechanisms of magical manifestation, synchronicity, personal effectiveness, and the impact of the unconscious on external reality. It appeals to practitioners of Chaos Magic, Hermeticism, and other traditions that integrate psychology into magical theory and practice, particularly concerning the interplay between belief, intention, and external events in daily life and relationship dynamics."
