    "description": "The practical system outlined in 'Geomantica Exorcismi' combines elements of geomantic divination (implied by title and diagrams) with explicit ceremonial magic for the conjuration and control of various spiritual entities, primarily demons. The practitioner employs divine names, specific oaths, and a range of ritual tools to compel these spirits to perform various tasks, from revealing hidden knowledge and treasures to influencing events and providing protection. The system appears to be rooted in Abrahamic traditions, particularly the Solomonic lore of binding spirits.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This manuscript is highly relevant to the study of grimoire traditions, particularly those associated with Solomonic magic and early modern demonology/exorcism. It provides primary source insights into the practical application of geomancy (though less explicit in the OCR) alongside explicit spirit conjuration. Its Greek language suggests a continuation or transmission of classical or Byzantine magical traditions into later grimoire forms, offering a unique perspective on the historical development of Western Esotericism.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes advanced practitioners of ceremonial magic, academic researchers in Western Esotericism, historians of occultism, and scholars specializing in ancient and medieval Greek magical texts. Effective utilization requires significant linguistic proficiency in Greek and a deep understanding of grimoire traditions and magical theory."
