  "central_thesis": "The book presents itself as a foundational esoteric text, 'El Ntuán,' containing the 'Words of the Creator' (Sambi/Nzambi Mpungu). Its central thesis is that ultimate divine power resides within every human being, who is a direct manifestation of the Creator. Through rigorous spiritual study, disciplined practice of specific rituals, chants, and mental exercises (Amuliwa, Umoja), practitioners can awaken and master this inherent 'power of the one' (Ngunsa Yesi). This mastery allows for manifestation of desires, healing, dimensional travel, and ultimately, achieving a state of perfect union with the Creator and immortality, transcending the limitations of the physical world and escaping negative karmic cycles.",

Al llega a la tribu ya Masilonyane estaba muy mal y no duro mucho tiempo y murió por las heridas y la enfermedad y Bantu corrió a la montaña donde estaba Dios y Nzambi le dijo; Has una Nganga con el cuerpo de Masilonyane y que este Nkisi tendrá la fuerza para curar o matar, y te dará remedio a tus males, ahí debería hacer sus sacrificio y dar sus ofrendas por siempre y yo vendré para ayudarte cuando tengas problemas, pero debes ser obediente y de ahora en lo adelante y por siempre deberán rayarse y con su sangre jurar su obediencia a mi Nzambi, y así todos recordaran sus juramentos. Así nació la primera religión o Regla de Palo Monte Mayombe.",

Entre las tribus y las personas de la tierra muchas enseñanzas buenas y muchas religiones buenas hay, pero ellos no saben la verdad de todas las cosas, por consiguiente ve por toda la tierra y les enseñan las cosas que yo te instruiré. Yo hice todo lo que hay, y he hecho todo perfecto, y significa que el hombre debe mantener todo perfecto, y también le di el Poder al hombre para hacer con el mundo como él le plazca. Si haces las cosas positivas, sólo cosas positivas vendrán a ti, y vendrá a ti diez veces. Si haces las cosas negativas, sólo cosas negativas vendrán a ti y volverán diez veces.

Cuando usted va entre estas dos fuerzas y utiliza un poco de ambas igualmente que se llama Ambiata y es dicho que usted está utilizando Ambiata. Cuando usted utiliza la fuerza del uno o la fuerza dividida pues la fuerza es realmente usted, usted es el Prava de si. Usted es el amo de esta fuerza entonces Prava significa el “amo de la fuerza”, por lo tanto si usted domina el arte de usar esta fuerza del uno sin dividirla, usted es el Prava de si.",

    "relevance": "This book, 'El Ntuán,' is presented as a foundational and comprehensive text for Palo Monte Mayombe Regla Kimbiza Sagrada Sarabanda, an Afro-Cuban religious and magical tradition. It contextualizes the religion's origins, cosmology, ethics, and practical magic within a grand narrative of creation, human evolution, and cosmic cycles. The claim that this tradition predates and underpins many other world religions and belief systems (including aspects of ancient Egypt, India, Tibet, and even a critique of Christianity) is a common assertion in esoteric literature seeking to establish antiquity and supreme authority. The emphasis on inner power, manifestation through thought, and personal responsibility aligns with currents in modern Western Esotericism, particularly Chaos Magic's subjective belief systems and Gnostic ideas of self-divinization. The prophecies of future world changes, the rise of a 'beast religion,' and the ultimate triumph of the Brujos resonate with apocalyptic and millenarian themes found in various occult and religious traditions.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience is primarily initiates and serious practitioners of Palo Monte Mayombe Regla Kimbiza Sagrada Sarabanda. The text is dense, requires extensive study ('many years'), and contains secrets revealed only to initiates ('Se le dirá después de su iniciación aquí con nosotros'). It is also aimed at individuals interested in the theoretical and practical aspects of Afro-Cuban religions, comparative esotericism, and operative magic who are seeking a comprehensive spiritual system. The warnings against misuse of power and the detailed, step-by-step instructions for rituals indicate an audience committed to ethical and disciplined practice, rather than casual curiosity."
