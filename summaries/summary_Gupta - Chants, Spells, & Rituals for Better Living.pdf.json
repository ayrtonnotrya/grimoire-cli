  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "Chants, Spells and Rituals for Better Living is a highly practical and accessible manual reflecting a stream of popular occultism common in the late 20th century, particularly from publishers like Finbarr Books. It simplifies complex magickal theory, focusing on direct application for common desires (money, love, protection). Its emphasis on psychological suggestibility aligns with modern perspectives in Chaos Magic and some psychological approaches to occultism, though it also maintains a connection to more traditional \"external supernatural agencies.\" It bridges folk magic (Voodoo elements, herbalism) with a generalized, results-oriented \"magick\" for the layperson. The inclusion of specific supply houses and other recommended books roots it firmly in the contemporary occult market of its time.",
    "target_audience": "The book is explicitly aimed at the \"ordinary person,\" the \"everyday lay woman or man,\" who is \"fascinated by witchcraft and its possibilities, but is either too busy or apprehensive to actually get involved in it\" (from Jean Williams' \"Winning with Witchcraft\" blurb, which represents the same market). It targets individuals seeking immediate, tangible results (\"better living\") without extensive theoretical study, specialized knowledge, or complex initiatory practices. It is for those interested in self-empowerment through simplified magickal techniques to address practical life issues like financial gain, romantic relationships, and protection from negativity."
