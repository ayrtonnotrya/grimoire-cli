    "relevance": "These principles, adopted in 1974 by the Council of American Witches (C.A.W.), are historically significant as a foundational ethical and philosophical statement for a broad spectrum of modern Witchcraft and Wiccan traditions in North America. They serve as a clear counter-narrative to popular misconceptions, particularly concerning Satanism and malevolence, distinguishing Witchcraft as a nature-revering, self-empowering, and ecologically conscious spiritual path. Their emphasis on non-hierarchy, pluralism, and individual responsibility aligns with the broader counter-cultural and new religious movement trends of the era and continues to resonate with contemporary practitioners seeking an earth-centered and personally directed spirituality. While not a practical grimoire, they provide the essential worldview for operative magic within many contemporary traditions.",
    "target_audience": "Individuals interested in modern Witchcraft, Neopaganism, or those seeking an alternative spiritual path focused on nature, personal growth, and self-responsibility. This document is also relevant for academics studying contemporary religious movements and Western Esotericism, offering insight into the ethical and philosophical underpinnings of an evolving spiritual tradition."
