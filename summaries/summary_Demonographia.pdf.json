      "text": "Abigor, demon of a superior order, grand duke of the infernal monarchy. Sixty legions march under his orders.

      "text": "Asmodée, destroying demon, the same as Samall, according to several rabbis. He is the superintendent of the gaming houses. He sows dissipation and error... When one exorcises him, it is necessary to be steadfast and to call him by his name. He gives rings made under the influence of a certain constellation, he advises men on how to render themselves invisible and instructs them in geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and the mechanical arts.",

      "text": "Astaroth, very powerful grand-duke of hell. He has the form of an extremely ugly angel, and shows himself astride a hellish dragon; he holds a viper in his left hand... On account of that it is prudent to hold under his nostrils a silver magic ring, which is a preservative against the fetid odors of demons.",

His name signifies 'lord of the flies.'... One sees in Solomon's Clavicules that Belzébuth appears sometimes in monstrous form, like that of an enormous calf or a goat with a long tail; nonetheless, he is often shown with the face of an ugly fly.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "Collin de Plancy's 'Dictionnaire Infernal' is a pivotal work in Western Esotericism, particularly in the grimoire tradition, serving as a comprehensive and highly influential reference for demonology. It synthesizes and illustrates information from a multitude of older grimoires, theological texts, and folklore, making obscure entities accessible. Its detailed descriptions of demonic attributes, powers, and appearances have significantly shaped subsequent occult literature and popular culture's understanding of infernal beings. The work provides a structured, if eclectic, overview of the infernal hierarchy, aiding in the identification and operative engagement with specific entities for various magical purposes, from divination to gaining knowledge or influence.",

It also appeals to those with an interest in esoteric folklore, comparative mythology, and the intersection of religion and the occult, particularly regarding the Western tradition of demonology."
