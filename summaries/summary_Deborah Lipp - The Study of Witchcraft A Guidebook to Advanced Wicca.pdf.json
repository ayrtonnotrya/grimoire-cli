      "term": "Radical Empowerment Wicca",
      "definition": "A type of Wicca often associated with feminism and political activism, emphasizing democratic consensus or rotating leadership, freeform/spontaneous rituals, self-declared witchcraft, and valuing ritual process over outcome for inner power and social egalitarianism."
    },
    {
      "term": "Gentle Eclecticism Wicca",
      "definition": "A highly individualized form of Wicca primarily defined by adherence to the Wiccan Rede ('An it harm none, do as ye will') and the Rule of Three. It emphasizes solitary practice, self-initiation, and adapts rituals and beliefs from various sources without strict adherence to specific traditions or rules beyond the Rede."
    },
    {
      "term": "Wicca vs. Witchcraft",
      "definition": "Wicca is defined as a religion with specific characteristics (Polarity, Immanence, Nature, Magic, Circles/Quarters), while Witchcraft is a broader magical practice encompassing folk charms, spells, and other arts.

      "term": "Polarity (Wicca)",
      "definition": "A fundamental Wiccan principle, stating that regardless of one's specific deity beliefs, ritual and spiritual work consistently incorporates a goddess and a god, often present on the altar during ceremonies."

    {
      "term": "Immanence (Wicca)",
      "definition": "The core Wiccan belief in the sacredness of the human being, often expressed as 'If that which thou seekest, thou findest not within thee, thou wilt never find it without thee' or 'Thou Art God,' implying that inner guidance comes from the divine within."
    },
    {
      "term": "Synchronicity",
      "definition": "As defined by Carl Jung, synchronicity is 'meaningful coincidence.' In divination, it's the belief that by generating randomness (e.g., shuffling cards), the universe can communicate meaningful messages through the patterns that emerge, connecting the inner self to external forces."
    },
    {
      "term": "Psychic Shielding",
      "definition": "An active mind skill, usually involving visualization, to create a protective barrier around oneself. It's taught as essential for Wiccans who develop psychic sensitivity, allowing them to block negative influences while remaining open to beneficial ones."

      "term": "Magical Thinking ('Wishcraft')",
      "definition": "A concept, often critiqued in psychology, referring to the belief in having inordinate control over the universe.

    },
    {
      "term": "The Burning Times",
      "definition": "The historical period, roughly from the mid-16th through the late 17th centuries, during which purported witches were persecuted, tortured, and executed.
