It codified many rituals, ethical guidelines, and philosophical tenets that became common across various Wiccan traditions.

It represents a pivotal shift towards Goddess-centric, nature-based spirituality within Western Esotericism.",

Beyond that, it is invaluable for academic scholars of Neopaganism, religious studies, and Western Esotericism, as well as practitioners of other traditional witchcraft paths and occultists interested in the historical development and practical mechanics of modern magical systems."
