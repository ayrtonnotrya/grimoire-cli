It combines classical Hermetic Qabalah (Tree of Life, Sephiroth, 32 Paths) with Golden Dawn ritual practices, detailed Tarot symbolism, and planetary/zodiacal invocations. A central operative component is Steven Ashe's 'Qabalah of Fifty Gates,' an experiential system for navigating states of mind derived from the Sephiroth and Paths to achieve self-realization. The Shemhamphorash provides a method for identifying and invoking specific angelic forces (Guardian Angels) tailored to an individual's birth chart, emphasizing balancing and enhancing physical, personal, and spiritual aspects of being. The system stresses disciplined effort, attunement, and conscious engagement with symbolic metaphors to achieve 'Psycho-Telios' (perfection of the Self).",
