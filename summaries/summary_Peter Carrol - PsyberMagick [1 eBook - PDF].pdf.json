  "central_thesis": "PsyberMagick presents a radical, scientific, and pragmatic re-evaluation of magic, positing a six-dimensional 'psispacetime' continuum (three spatial, three temporal including two imaginary time dimensions) as the theoretical underpinning for magical operations. The book argues that magic functions by manipulating probabilities within this extended temporal framework. A core philosophical tenet is 'Anontology,' advocating for a shift from a 'being'-centric to a 'doing'-centric worldview, asserting that nothing 'is' but rather 'does.' This approach views magic as the 'science and art of forcing time into desired patterns by will and perception,' challenging traditional occult, religious, and even scientific paradigms with a 'vibrant post-modernist Chaoism.'",

Its innovative integration of advanced physics concepts (like six-dimensional spacetime, imaginary time, and spinwarp theory) with magical theory provides a unique intellectual foundation for practical work. Carroll's direct challenge to traditional 'being'-centric metaphysics through Anontology and Antispells compels practitioners to fundamentally re-evaluate their linguistic and conceptual tools. The 'heresy' chapters are crucial for stripping away dogmatic assumptions, making the work relevant for those seeking a rigorous, results-oriented, and post-modern approach to magic that is deeply skeptical of conventional spiritualities and politics.",

It appeals to individuals interested in the theoretical and philosophical intersections of magic, physics, and consciousness. It is explicitly not for novices, those seeking conventional spiritual comfort, or practitioners bound by traditional dogma, as it aggressively deconstructs many established occult and religious beliefs."
