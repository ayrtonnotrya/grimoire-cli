    "relevance": "This document is a scientific research paper focused on empirical parapsychology, investigating the statistical correlation between personality traits and ESP performance under controlled ganzfeld conditions. Its relevance to 'Western Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic' is indirect, as it does not present a magical system or philosophy. While it examines anomalous phenomena, it does so from a psychological and statistical perspective, not an occult operative one. The findings suggest certain psychological profiles might be associated with higher 'psi-hitting,' which could tangentially inform practitioners interested in psychological predispositions to psychic experiences, but it offers no direct magical techniques or esoteric interpretations.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience for this paper is primarily academic researchers in parapsychology, psychology, and cognitive science, as well as students and practitioners interested in the empirical study of Extra-Sensory Perception and individual differences. It is not intended for occultists, magicians, or those seeking practical instruction in esoteric or magical systems."
