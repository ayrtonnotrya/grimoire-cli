The text emphasizes purity, faith, and the authority derived from divine names and Christian figures, presenting itself as a \"Catholic Magical Tract\" despite its 'nigromantic' subject matter.",

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system described in \"De Nigromancia\" is a highly structured form of ceremonial magic focused on the summoning, binding, and commanding of spirits (both celestial and infernal) through an authoritative, Christianized framework. Success is predicated on the operator's extreme physical and moral purity, meticulous adherence to astrological timings (planetary hours, moon phases), precise construction and consecration of magical tools (Sword, Sceptre, Ring, Plate), and the accurate invocation of divine and angelic names (especially Tetragrammaton). The magic is highly operative, aiming to achieve specific, tangible outcomes, such as locating hidden treasures, compelling a thief to confess, or securing supernatural transport. The emphasis on the \"Mass of St. Cyprian\" and the invocation of Christian saints and figures suggests an attempt to legitimize or empower the magical operations within a religious context.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "\"De Nigromancia\" is a significant text for understanding the historical development of grimoire traditions, particularly within a Christianized framework. It provides a unique lens into how classical magic, often considered pagan or demonic, was integrated or adapted within a supposedly \"Catholic Magical Tract\" context, reflecting syncretic practices of the late medieval or early modern period. Its attribution to Roger Bacon, a historical figure associated with experimental science and alchemy, further contextualizes it within a tradition that sought to systematize and rationalize magical operations. The text's detailed instructions for summoning spirits, crafting talismans, and performing specific operations (like treasure finding or thief catching) align it with practical operative magic, distinct from purely philosophical or mystical esotericism. The editor's commentary on its comparison with the \"Necronomicon\" and its use within a \"Catholic\" exorcism context highlights the ongoing reinterpretation and practical application of such texts in modern occultism, even if anachronistic.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience would be advanced practitioners and academic researchers in Western Esotericism, occultism, and grimoire traditions. Its dense, archaic language, coupled with highly specific and demanding ritual instructions, makes it unsuitable for beginners. Practitioners interested in historical ceremonial magic, particularly those seeking to reconstruct or understand medieval/early modern magical systems, would find it invaluable. Additionally, scholars of religious studies, history, and folklore specializing in magic and its cultural contexts would find the text's blend of Christian invocation and operative magic highly relevant."
