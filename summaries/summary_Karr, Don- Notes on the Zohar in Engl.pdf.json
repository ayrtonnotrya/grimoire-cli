  "practical_system": {
    "description": "This document itself is a meta-analysis of texts and not a practical system for magic or esotericism. However, it meticulously describes and contextualizes the Zohar, which is the foundational text for classical Kabbalah. The Zohar outlines a comprehensive mystical philosophy involving divine emanations (Sefirot), archetypal structures (Parzufim), celestial realms (Hekhalot), and esoteric interpretations of the Torah, all of which form the basis for Kabbalistic contemplation, meditation, and ritual practices aimed at spiritual ascent and understanding divine mysteries.",
    "tools": [
      "The primary 'tool' discussed implicitly throughout this document is the Zohar itself—as a text for study, contemplation, and esoteric interpretation. Different translations are evaluated based on their utility as tools for accessing the Zohar's profound mystical content, with particular attention to explanatory notes, commentaries, and fidelity to the original Aramaic/Hebrew."
    ],
    "rituals": [
      "While this document does not prescribe rituals, it references studies of Kabbalistic practices, such as 'yihudim' (unifications) in Spanish Kabbalah (Verman), and the ritual aspects discussed in Idel's works, indicating that the Zohar contains the philosophical and mystical underpinnings for various contemplative and theurgic actions in Kabbalah."

      "text": "Work concerning the authorship and chronology of the zoharic strata is on-going, though most scholars agree that the main body of the Zohar was written by Rabbi Moses de Leon (1250-1305) and perhaps some others in his circle toward the end of the thirteenth century into the beginning of the fourteenth.",

The innumerable deliberate falsifications of the French translator, Jean de Pauly, are of course not to be found in this more solid and workmanlike translation.\"",
