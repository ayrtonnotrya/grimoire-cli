      "summary": "Introduces the 'pro attitude' as a necessary condition for psychopractic effects, defined as a favorable conscious or unconscious attitude.

      "summary": "Identifies problems with previous investigations, citing Heath's research which suggests that extreme 'investment' or 'trust in the process' creates adverse conditions for psi, implying a non-linear relationship. Re-analysis of Storm's (2002a) data, by trimming extreme scores (1, 2, 6, 7), revealed a significant negative correlation between pro attitude (mid-range scores 3, 4, 5) and hexagram-hitting, supporting the idea that moderate interest/trust is optimal."

      "summary": "Discusses the psychopractic theory's third principle: the necessity of an ensemble of 'necessary conditions' to achieve a paranormal effect. Introduces the 'sheep-goat effect' (psi belief) as another identified necessary condition. Data combining Storm's (2002a) sample with another pooled sample (N=243) showed 'believers' (sheep) had significantly greater hexagram hits than chance, while 'skeptics' (goats) scored at chance."

      "summary": "Concludes that extreme scores on motivational and emotional variables should be treated with caution in psi research. Recommends experimenters use dual-testing procedures to identify and accumulate necessary conditions, focusing on sub-samples that elicit paranormal effects, as the psychopractic approach predicts stronger effects as more conditions are met."

    "description": "The paper outlines a research methodology for identifying 'necessary conditions' for psychopractic effects through I Ching hexagram-hitting experiments. It advocates for careful measurement and analysis of participant variables like 'pro attitude' (interest/desire for a favorable outcome) and 'psi belief' (sheep-goat distinction). The core practical implication for a practitioner is that for successful 'hexagram-hitting' (or by extension, other psi/magical effects), one should cultivate a moderate, balanced level of intention/desire ('caring with trust') rather than excessive or insufficient 'pro attitude.' Belief in psi is also posited as a fundamental necessary condition.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This research is highly relevant to understanding the subtle interplay of subjective states with purported paranormal phenomena, particularly within divination systems like the I Ching. For occultists, it offers a quasi-scientific framework for examining how magical intention (the 'pro attitude') and belief ('sheep-goat effect') might not operate as simple linear amplifiers but rather require a nuanced, perhaps balanced, state for optimal efficacy. The finding that extreme desire can be counterproductive aligns with esoteric teachings emphasizing detachment or 'will without wanting.' It provides a rare attempt to scientifically study the 'operative' side of a historically esoteric tool.",
    "target_audience": "Academic researchers and practitioners in parapsychology, experimental psychologists studying anomalous cognition, and serious students of Western Esotericism and Occultism who are interested in the scientific investigation of consciousness, intention, and belief in magical or divinatory outcomes."
