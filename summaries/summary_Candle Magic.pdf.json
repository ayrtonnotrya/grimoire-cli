  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system outlined is a structured, operative form of candle magic, emphasizing preparation, intention, and specific ritual actions. It mandates the cleansing and consecration of unused candles to purify them of extraneous energies. Practitioners select candles based on color and form correspondences (e.g., figure candles), aligning with the ritual's intent, elements, deities, and astrological timing. The core operative phase involves 'dressing' the candle by anointing it with blessed oil (in specific motions for achievement or banishment) and engraving symbols or petitions. Focused visualization during burning is critical, and rituals often conclude with deliberate extinguishing (snuffing, not blowing) to preserve the magical energy. The system is designed to create a direct psychic link between the magician's will and the candle's symbolic action, leading to desired outcomes.",
