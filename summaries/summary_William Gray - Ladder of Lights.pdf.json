The goal is to integrate the Tree's patterns into one's life, achieve inner balance, interpret symbols for guidance, and ultimately attain 'AT-ONE-MENT' with Divinity.

The work is highly relevant for those seeking to apply Qabalistic principles to their own lives.",

It is intended for individuals seeking a 'step-by-step guide' to the Tree of Life, rather than solely academic scholars, though its depth and unique interpretations also make it valuable for researchers in the field."
