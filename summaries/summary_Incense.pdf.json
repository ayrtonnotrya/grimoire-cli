    },
    {
      "term": "Planetary Hours",

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system presented in 'Incense' centers on the alchemical and astrological preparation and use of incenses, anointing oils, and perfumes to create specific energetic 'atmospheres' for magical operations. This involves selecting natural ingredients based on their planetary, elemental, or zodiacal correspondences, and compounding them at precise astrological times (planetary hours and days) to imbue them with desired virtues. The core philosophy is that specific odours and subtle vibrations attract or repel particular forces, influencing the outcome of rituals. The practitioner is encouraged to develop a 'nose' for incense and to experiment with ratios to suit personal needs, while maintaining a dedicated ritual space and appropriate tools.",
