The novel blends ancient magical systems (Mayan, Egyptian) and figures (Hassan i Sabbah) with modern concepts of viruses, radiation, and technology to propose a meta-system for consciousness control, identity transfer, and reality editing. It challenges conventional notions of linear time and fixed identity, reflecting a Chaos Magic perspective where belief systems are tools for operative effect rather than ultimate truths. The text functions as a fictional grimoire, detailing rituals, tools, and philosophical underpinnings for practical magical work in transforming both individual and societal realities.",
