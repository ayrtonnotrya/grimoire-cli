  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system outlined is one of 'natural magic,' focused on harmonizing with and directing the inherent energies of crystals, gemstones, and metals. The core mechanism involves a three-fold requirement for successful magic: 'Necessidade' (Need), 'Emoção' (Emotion), and 'Conhecimento' (Knowledge). The practitioner identifies a specific need, engages emotionally with it to generate power, and applies learned techniques ('Conhecimento') to direct this energy. This energy is channeled through visualization into selected stones or metals, which then act as foci or amplifiers to manifest the desired change. The system emphasizes intuition, personal exploration, and working respectfully with natural forces, advocating for simple, direct enchantments over convoluted ceremonial magic.",

    "relevance": "Scott Cunningham's 'Enciclopédia de Cristais, Pedras Preciosas e Metais' is presented as a significant contribution to the field of natural magic, specifically concerning lithomancy and metallomancy. It seeks to make the practice of magic with these materials accessible to a broad audience, positioning itself as a practical guide that transcends complex rituals and expensive tools. The book's emphasis on the inherent, natural energies of stones and metals, and its focus on personal transformation and healing, aligns it with modern New Age and neo-pagan movements, particularly Wicca. Cunningham explicitly states his intent to reveal 'secrets' often hidden in rare texts, aiming to fill a gap in literature by offering a comprehensive, operative system for working with these materials.",
    "target_audience": "The author explicitly targets a very broad audience, including individuals from all walks of life—autodidacts, professionals, students, seasoned magicians (magos), Wiccans, and even those entirely new to the concept of magic. The book's accessibility is underscored by the author's promise that it does not require extensive study, costly instruments, or adherence to complicated rituals, making it suitable for anyone seeking positive changes in their life, regardless of age, financial status, or current health."
