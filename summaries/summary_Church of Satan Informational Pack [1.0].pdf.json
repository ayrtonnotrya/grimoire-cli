  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The Church of Satan's practical system is rooted in applying an ego-centric, rational philosophy to daily life, emphasizing self-deification, personal empowerment, and the pursuit of individual desires. It distinguishes between Greater Magic (ritual-based psychological influence) and Lesser Magic (mundane manipulation). The system promotes an 'Alien Elite' mindset, encouraging personal accomplishment, critical thinking, and a rejection of herd conformity. Affiliation with the Church is an organizational option, but true Satanism is described as a 'born' predisposition and a way of life, not merely a membership.",
