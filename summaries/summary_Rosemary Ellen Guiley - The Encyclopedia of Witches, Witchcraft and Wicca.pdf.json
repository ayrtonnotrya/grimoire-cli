    {
      "text": "Centuries ago, the inquisitors and witch-hunters who executed witches as servants of the Devil believed they were doing a service to God and humanity. They envisioned a society free of witchcraft, which they viewed as heresy, a scourge, an evil and a blight. They would be astonished today to find that Witchcraft—with a capital W—has become one of the fastest-growing religions in Western culture.",

      "text": "The magic comes either from the Greek megus, which means “great” (as in “great” science), or from the Greek term magein, the science and religion of Zoroaster. Numerous definitions of magic have been offered by many who have practiced and studied it, yet magic eludes precise description. Though systems of magic exist—and some are quite complex—magic remains an individualistic experience. Every person who practices magic sees it in a different way.",

    {
      "text": "The Malleus Maleficarum was written by two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger. The two men were empowered by Pope Innocent VIII in his Bull of December 9, 1484, to prosecute witches throughout northern Germany. The papal edict was intended to quell Protestant opposition to the Inquisition and to solidify the case made in 1258 by Pope Alexander IV for the prosecution of witches as heretics. It was the opinion of the church that the secular arm, the civil courts, was not punishing enough witches solely on the basis of maleficia. The effect of both the bull and the Malleus Maleficarum spread far beyond Germany, its greatest influence being felt in France and Italy and, to a lesser extent, in England. It was adopted by both Protestant and Catholic civil and ecclesiastical judges.",
