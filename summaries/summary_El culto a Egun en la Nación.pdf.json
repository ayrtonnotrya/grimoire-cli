It argues for the critical importance of proper Egun veneration, asserting that it is as vital as Orisha worship itself, and indeed, that the cult of Orisha cannot exist without the foundation of Egun.",

It emphasizes ritual purity, moral conduct, and strict adherence to tradition, primarily performed by initiated men. The core operative principle is that honoring Egun is indispensable for the proper functioning and prosperity of the Orisha cult and the well-being of the living community.",

It provides an 'insider' perspective, correcting common misinterpretations in some syncretic traditions (e.g., Umbanda, Kimbanda) by grounding Egun veneration firmly within traditional Yoruba and Djéjé-Nagô frameworks. Its detailed explication of the symbiotic relationship between Egun and Orisha cults, the specific conditions for achieving Egun status, and the intricate funerary rites offers a crucial missing link for many. From an occult perspective, it presents a highly structured system of ancestor magic, emphasizing energetic stability, spiritual evolution, and protective functions, which is often diluted or misunderstood in other magical paradigms.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience includes initiated practitioners (babalórișà, babaláwò, and other religious leaders) of Candomblé, Umbanda, Kimbanda, and other Afro-Diasporic traditions, particularly those seeking a deeper, more traditional understanding of Egun cult. Additionally, academics in anthropology, religious studies, and esotericism would find it valuable for its detailed cultural and ritualistic information. Anyone interested in practical ancestor veneration from an authentic, non-Western esoteric perspective would also benefit."
