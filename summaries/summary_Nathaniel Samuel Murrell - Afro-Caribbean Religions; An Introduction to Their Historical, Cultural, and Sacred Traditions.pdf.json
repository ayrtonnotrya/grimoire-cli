  "central_thesis": "This book argues that Afro-Caribbean religions are vital elements of Caribbean culture, linking peoples to their African past and representing resilient, adaptive, and creolized spiritual systems. It posits that these religions, originating from known African Traditional Religions (ATRs), developed in response to colonial oppression, providing a framework for historical resistance, cultural identity, and spiritual empowerment, which can be studied sui generis.",

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The operative systems within Afro-Caribbean religions are designed for practical engagement with spiritual forces to influence daily life, obtain protection, healing, and guidance. They involve a hierarchical cosmos with a supreme deity, intermediary divinities (lwa, orishas, mpungus), and revered ancestors. Practitioners (priests, priestesses, shamans, mediums) act as conduits, employing specific rituals, offerings, and sacred objects to establish communication and harness spiritual energy (ashe). The efficacy of these systems is believed to stem from proper execution of rites, specialized knowledge, and faith, addressing physical, mental, social, and economic needs.",

It demonstrates the enduring resilience, adaptability, and profound socio-cultural and political significance of these spiritual traditions as systems of resistance and identity for oppressed peoples. Its focus on the creolization process, operational mechanics, and diverse manifestations of African spirituality across various islands and Brazil makes it a valuable resource for understanding the complex interplay of religion, culture, and power in the diaspora.",
