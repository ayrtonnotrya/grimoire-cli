Its multi-layered analysis of Hebrew letters, Runes (including a deliberate effort to 'cleanse' them from Nazi appropriation), and astrological symbols provides a rich framework for advanced practitioners. The book serves as a vital resource for those seeking a deeply spiritual and psychologically transformative approach to Tarot, integrating ancient wisdom with modern challenges.",
