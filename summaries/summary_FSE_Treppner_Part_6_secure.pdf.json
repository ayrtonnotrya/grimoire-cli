  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system revolves around interpreting a 36-card Lenormand Grand Tableau to answer specific questions for a querent. It employs a multi-layered approach: 1. General Overview: Initial scan for prominent themes, positive/negative indicators. 2. Key Combinations: Identifying two or three-card groupings with significant meaning. 3. House Interpretation: Analyzing cards based on the meaning of the positions they fall into. 4. Reflections: Examining cards diagonally opposed for deeper insights or mirroring influences. 5. Knighting: Applying the chess knight's move to find subtle connections and influences between cards. 6. Corresponding Cards: Focusing on specific cards relevant to the question. 7. Directionality: Noting the orientation of cards like Scythe or Clouds for directional influence. The goal is to build a coherent narrative that directly addresses the querent's inquiries, moving from broad themes to precise answers.",
