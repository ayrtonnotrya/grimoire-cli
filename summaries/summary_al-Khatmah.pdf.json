    "relevance": "This manuscript is a highly significant primary source for understanding Islamic esotericism, particularly within the Maghrebi tradition. It expertly blends Sufi devotional practices, Quranic mysticism, and the practical application of letter and number magic (Ilm al-Huruf and Ilm al-Awfaq). It demonstrates how such 'occult' practices are integrated into an orthodox Islamic framework, presenting a sophisticated system for achieving spiritual elevation, protection, and divinely sanctioned authority. Its detailed diagrams and nuanced textual references offer invaluable insights into the operative aspects of traditional Islamic magical arts.",

A deep command of Arabic language, Islamic theology, and esoteric symbolism is essential to comprehend and effectively practice the system. It is not a general devotional text but a specialized manual for those seeking profound spiritual development and the practical application of divine and prophetic powers."
