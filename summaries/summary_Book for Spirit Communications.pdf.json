It is sensitive to light but may be photographed using infrared film."
    },
    {
      "term": "Trance",
      "definition": "An altered state of consciousness where the brainwave activity moves to a certain level. There are basically four such levels: beta, alpha, theta, and delta. Beta is the normal, wide-awake level. Next level down is the alpha level (what might be termed a 'light' trance). Below that is the theta, and deepest (equivalent of somnambulism in hypnosis) is delta; a deep trance state. Mediums enter trance, consciously or unconsciously, to various levels."
    },
    {
      "term": "Clairvoyance",

    },
    {
      "term": "Automatic Writing",

    {
      "term": "Table Tipping",

      "term": "Apport",
      "definition": "A gift brought, by spirit, to a sitter at a séance. The word comes from the French apporter, 'to bring.'

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system outlined by Buckland is a progressive, structured approach to developing mediumistic abilities, moving from foundational psychic sensitivity exercises to more advanced techniques like trance mediumship and physical manifestations. It emphasizes consistency, ethical practice, and often, group work within 'development circles' to enhance and validate experiences. The approach integrates mental discipline (meditation, visualization) with physical interaction (e.g., talking boards, psychometry, automatic writing) to bridge the gap between the practitioner and the spirit world, with a strong focus on personal development as a prerequisite for effective contact.",

Its emphasis on ethical practice and the importance of development circles provides a solid framework for aspiring practitioners, making it a foundational text for those serious about exploring spirit communication beyond mere theory. The work contextualizes Spiritualism as a verifiable phenomenon, reflecting a specific historical and philosophical current within esotericism.",
