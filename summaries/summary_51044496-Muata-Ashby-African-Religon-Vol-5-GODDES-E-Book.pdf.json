The very basis of this program of worship is an understanding that Asar, the Self, has been dismembered and it is the Goddess who reconstitutes his body and who provides the nourishment and nursing which is required to bring the Spirit back to life. You will notice that the supplication to the Goddess is a feminine direction both in Asar and in Heru. This is because Asar and Heru are in reality one and the same. The resurrection of Asar is synonymous with the vindication and reascension of Heru.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant for contemporary esoteric studies due to its syncretic approach, bridging Ancient Egyptian and Indian spiritual traditions through the lens of 'Egyptian Yoga.' It offers a unique perspective on goddess worship, emphasizing the divine feminine's role in creation, spiritual evolution, and archetypal psychology. The practical focus on rituals and ethical conduct provides a structured, accessible path for practitioners interested in non-dual philosophy and self-transformation within a Kemetic framework. The detailed mystical interpretations of myths offer depth beyond mere narrative retelling.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes practitioners of Western Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic who are specifically interested in Kemetic (Ancient Egyptian) spirituality, Goddess worship, and Hermeticism. It is also suitable for those seeking a syncretic spiritual path that integrates Eastern (Yoga) philosophical and meditative elements with Western mystical traditions. Scholars of comparative religion, mythology, and spiritual philosophy would also find value in Ashby's unique synthesis."
