    "description": "The practical system outlined is 'white magick,' rooted in ancient traditions (Celtic, Native American) and modern Wicca, designed for positive outcomes, healing, and personal/collective well-being. It operates on the principle of channeling the universal life force (Ch'i/prana) through focused intention, visualization, chanting, and ritual actions. The ethical core is the 'Threefold Law' ('An ye harm none, do what ye will'), ensuring that intentions are benevolent and actions are responsible, as energies rebound to the sender threefold. The system emphasizes accessing innate personal power ('the magick is within you') and harmonizing with natural cycles (Moon phases, Wheel of the Year). Rituals typically involve four stages: Focus (defining purpose with symbols/declarations), Action (endowing symbols with energy through movement, chant, knots), Raising the Power (amplifying energies into a 'cone of power' or 'cloud of energy'), and Release of Power (sending forth intentions into the cosmos, followed by grounding). The system encourages personal adaptation, creativity, and intuition in practice.",
