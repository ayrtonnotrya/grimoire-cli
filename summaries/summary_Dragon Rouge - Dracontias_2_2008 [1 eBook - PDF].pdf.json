  "key_concepts": [
    {
      "term": "Draconian Initiation",
      "definition": "A structured magical process within Dragon Rouge, aimed at personal development and the creation of one's own existence by harmonizing inner (Kundalini) and outer forces. It progresses through specific grades (e.g., Lilith 1.0°, Gamaliel 2.0°) and is associated with the 'dark pyramid of Draconian Illumination'."
    },
    {
      "term": "Antinomism (Left Hand Path)",
      "definition": "Within the Left Hand Path, this is a method for breaking free from unconscious structures and societal rules, fostering an inner ethical compass, and exploring existence beyond conventional boundaries, including the encounter with non-existence (death), to achieve ennoblement. It is explicitly distinguished from criminality."
    },
    {
      "term": "Dark Pyramid of Draconian Illumination",
      "definition": "A three-part conceptual foundation central to the dark magus's work, representing the active, interconnected aspects necessary for Draconian initiation and empowerment, leading to profound understanding and manifestation."
    },
    {
      "term": "Penurious Attitude",
      "definition": "A state of being in initiation where the practitioner sheds all 'means'—unnecessary magical objects, attitudes, and external dependencies—to stand as a focused individual, prepared for hard work and humility, thus accessing the wisdom of the 'black worlds'."
    },
    {
      "term": "Qliphoth",
      "definition": "The 'shells' or dark emanations associated with the inverse side of the Tree of Life in Qabalistic magic. In Draconian practice, they are explored for self-knowledge, transformation, and to challenge and integrate the 'shadow' aspects of existence."
    },
    {
      "term": "Kundalini (Inner & Outer)",
      "definition": "An immanent force residing within the individual, which, upon awakening, connects with and makes one aware of a permeating 'outer Kundalini' throughout creation. This dual activation is crucial for the magician to actively shape and create their own existence."
    },
    {
      "term": "Traditional Black Magic",
      "definition": "Practical magical actions, often drawing from historical grimoires and established methods, used for self-development, manifesting the magician's higher will, and solving 'lesser' mundane problems. It emphasizes the inherent power and contextual depth of inherited traditions over improvised rituals, though daily problems are ideally solved without magic."
    },
    {
      "term": "Uthark Theory",
      "definition": "A controversial theory (advocated by Sigurd Agrell) proposing a 'dark and secret' version of the rune row, known only to initiated rune masters. It is applied in Dragon Rouge for practical Nordic magic, exploring the dark dimension of runes and the underworld initiations associated with Odin and Hel."
    },
    {
      "term": "Lovecraftian Magic (Necronomicon Gnosis)",
      "definition": "A specific esoteric practice within Dragon Rouge, involving the exploration of concepts from H.P. Lovecraft's mythos, particularly 'Labyrinths of Zin' (identified with the Qliphothic 'Tunnels of Set'), through astral and dream-workings to access 'extra-terrestrial gnosis' and evolutionary transcendence."

  ],
  "practical_system": {
    "description": "Dragon Rouge operates a structured, graded magical system rooted in Draconian philosophy, emphasizing rigorous self-development, practical application, and adherence to traditional methods. Initiation progresses through distinct grades (e.g., Lilith 1.0°, Gamaliel 2.0°), supported by formal courses, lodge projects, and collective workings. The system integrates Qliphothic exploration, Kundalini activation, and antinomistic practices for profound personal transformation, aiming to enable the magician to create their own existence and achieve self-deification. It strongly advocates for using historical grimoires and established rituals, viewing them as powerful conduits for magical currents.",
