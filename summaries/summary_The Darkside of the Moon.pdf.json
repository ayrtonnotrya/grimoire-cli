    "description": "The magical system presented is an eclectic blend of ceremonial magic, folk magic, and grimoire traditions. Its core premise asserts that a practitioner's 'phase of mind'—a highly focused, subconscious, and disciplined mental state—is the primary mechanism for manipulating esoteric forces to achieve desired results. The system relies heavily on an intricate network of correspondences linking deities, planets, elements, colors, plants, metals, and other attributes to ritual components, ensuring alignment with the magical intention. Rituals involve rigorous preparation, including specific robes, altar setups, candle work, and the use of wands. Key operative techniques include precise invocations of deities and spirits, the creation of unique sigils from verbal intentions, the charging of fetishes or statuettes, and various forms of sympathetic magic. The scope of applications is broad, covering self-improvement, wealth attraction, love spells, protection, curse work, and even necromancy, often requiring a ritual assistant.",

Its detailed tables of correspondences and ritual instructions offer a tangible system for practical application.",

This includes those unafraid to explore practices that might be considered ethically questionable or dangerous, as implied by the explicit caution against emotionally disturbed persons attempting the rituals. The audience is likely results-oriented magicians rather than those solely focused on spiritual or philosophical growth."
