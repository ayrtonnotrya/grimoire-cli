      "term": "Perispiritual Body",
      "definition": "An energetic field or subtle body, described as residing a few millimeters above the physical skin, which registers an individual's karmic, spiritual, emotional, and mental dispositions. Spiritual diseases are believed to originate as 'lesions' on this body."

    {
      "term": "Disobsession",
      "definition": "A Spiritist procedure aimed at disentangling an 'obsessing spirit' (a discarnate entity) from a living person's perispiritual body. The goal is to facilitate the spirit's understanding of its state and guide it towards spiritual progression, thereby alleviating the spirit's influence on the patient's illness."

      "term": "Obsessing Spirit",
      "definition": "A discarnate entity, often characterized as 'lost' or unable to progress, that remains bound to a living person due to karmic debt or other energetic attachments. These spirits are believed to actively participate in and exacerbate the host's physical or psychological ailments."
    },
    {
      "term": "Fluidic Therapy",
      "definition": "A form of energy healing involving the application of 'life force' through a healer's hands or mental projection. This energy is used to counteract physical and perispiritual lesions and to restore energetic balance within the patient's system."

    {
      "term": "Medium",
      "definition": "An individual trained to consciously or unconsciously incorporate discarnate spirits, allowing them to communicate through the medium's physical apparatus. In disobsession, the medium serves as a temporary vessel for the obsessing spirit to be contacted and guided."

      "term": "Director",
      "definition": "A specialized role within a Spiritist center responsible for overseeing disobsession sessions.

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The Spiritist healing system described, drawing from Dr. Queiroz's teachings, posits that many ailments have a spiritual etiology, manifesting as 'lesions' on the 'perispiritual body' and often perpetuated by 'obsessing spirits.' The core practice is 'disobsession,' a mediated ritual to free both the patient and the intrusive spirit. This involves a trained medium allowing the obsessing spirit to temporarily 'incorporate' their physical form. A 'director' then communicates with the incorporated spirit, helping it comprehend its current state and guiding it towards its own spiritual evolution, thereby severing its energetic attachment to the patient. The process is supported by invocations of 'Christ energy' and 'helper/mentor spirits' and concluded with 'cleaners' performing energetic 'passes' to purify the participants and the space. The system is inherently collaborative, requiring specific roles for effective operation.",

      "text": "He explained that what he had seen was an obsessing spirit, a discarnate person who had died and lost the way to the next stage of evolution. By some karmic debt, it had become bound to Fran and was participating in her disease, supporting it and perhaps even helping to cause it. The indicated procedure was to perform a disobsession, whereby this intrusive spirit would be disentangled from Fran's perispiritual body and sent on its own way.",

Once again, I had a moment of truth, but this one was easier to resolve: my own commitment to this work had considerably deepened and I felt waves of love and support from all those present. I would step aside and allow the spirit in. Instantly, I went limp and felt a tightening in my throat as my body began to gently shake and sway.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This Spiritist system offers a structured and practical approach to psycho-spiritual healing through direct spirit interaction, aligning closely with operative occultism. Its focus on the 'perispiritual body' as a subtle energy field and the process of 'disobsession' resonates with esoteric traditions involving energy anatomy (e.g., Kabbalistic nefesh, ruach, neshamah concepts) and practices for dealing with parasitic or intrusive entities (e.g., banishing rituals, exorcism, spirit commanding in grimoires). The emphasis on guiding spirits toward 'spiritual progression' rather than mere expulsion distinguishes it from some banishing practices, suggesting a more compassionate and evolutionary approach to spirit work. It provides a unique lens for understanding the interplay between consciousness, karma, and disease, expanding the practical toolkit for those engaged in modern magical and healing practices.",
    "target_audience": "This text is highly relevant for occult practitioners, Western Esotericists, Chaos Magicians, and anyone interested in practical spirit work, mediumship development, and spiritual healing methodologies. It would also appeal to researchers in parapsychology, anthropology of consciousness, and transpersonal psychology who seek operative models for interaction with subtle entities and the remediation of spiritually-rooted ailments. Individuals studying comparative exorcism, spiritual cleansing, or energy healing practices would find this a valuable case study."
