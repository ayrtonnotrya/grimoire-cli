    "description": "The text outlines a system of 'esoteric extension of Tarot' focused on developing supersensory powers through meditation. The core mechanic involves directing focused mental energy, imbued with love and centered on beautiful aspects of life, towards desired manifestations. This can occur both consciously and unconsciously. The practice emphasizes cultivating a receptive state ('fishing' with the 'fish hook' of Tzaddi) to perceive and attract reality. It suggests integrating meditation into daily life, not restricting it to formal periods, by constantly seeking beauty and the divine in all occurrences.",
