The manual also covers methods for dream interpretation, the creation and charging of talismans for protection, and rituals for cleansing and spiritual maintenance. Emphasis is placed on precise actions, specific tools, and the power of language ('orin' and incantations) to direct spiritual energy, all within a strict lineage-based protocol for efficacy and authenticity.",
