      "summary": "This article discusses the Setian journey of self-transformation, termed 'Becoming' or 'Xeper', highlighting the initial daunting steps of ordering the self and eradicating detrimental routines. It emphasizes the importance of perseverance and willpower to overcome lapses from one's goals, noting that facing personal weaknesses in ritual is a significant challenge in the Left-Hand Path."

      "summary": "This piece explores the Setian view of time and the future, distinguishing 'will' (power over the future) from 'desire'. It asserts that the 'Gift of Set' enables Setians to actively 'will the future' rather than passively letting things 'happen'. The unknown future is linked to the 'blackest part of the Black Flame', requiring Setians to overcome fear and assert will to 'create time' and manifest their future in the present, aligning with Xeper's definition as 'coming into being under will'."

      "chapter_title": "[3] Horus & Set - The Year of the Heb-Sed",
      "summary": "This article analyzes the symbolic unification of Set and Horus, drawing parallels to the Egyptian Heb-Sed rite. It proposes that 'HarWer' represents a cosmic order where Horus the Elder governs the subjective universe (thoughts, feelings) and Set is the core self. For full self-consciousness, Set needs Horus the Elder. It advocates for harmony within the subjective universe for Setian initiation, while antinomianism is reserved for the objective universe and Right-Hand Path society, contrasting this with Horus the Younger who symbolizes the objective world Setians should dominate."

It re-tells a myth of Horus trapping Apep and relates serpent powers to subconscious forces, powers above/below ground, and primitive creation theories."

      "summary": "This article provides a detailed analysis of the Temple of Set's degree system as a 'formula for the evolution of consciousness', emphasizing Xeper as the sole tool for self-realization, not measured by degrees. It outlines the characteristics and challenges of each degree (First through Sixth), from 'escape from prison' and self-shaping at the Initiate level, to mastery of life and 'war' at the Master level, and finally affecting others to 'grow into gods' at the Ipsissimi stage. It highlights the importance of overcoming fear and achieving harmony within one's subjective universe throughout the process."

The Pylon aims to advance Xeper through these unique methods."

It frames Setians, especially II°+ Initiates, as 'antichrists' from a magical perspective, linking 'energized consciousness' to the 'Mark of the Beast'. It challenges Setians to confront Biblical prophecies and their own predispositions, advocating for a strategic shift away from public Satanism for the Temple's preservation while maintaining antinomian principles against Christianity."

The system emphasizes actively willing the future, rather than passively accepting it. This includes mastering one's subjective universe (Horus the Elder) while applying antinomian principles to the objective world (Horus the Younger). Progression through a structured degree system (Initiate to Ipsissimi) provides a framework for evolving consciousness, with each stage requiring specific tasks like self-discovery, communication, and strategic action. Communal workings like Conclaves and Pylons serve as 'large workings' that amplify individual will and facilitate collective magical endeavors.",

It also addresses internal and external challenges, such as the public perception of Satanism and the practicalities of communal workings (conclaves, pylons). The recurring emphasis on overcoming fear, asserting will, and the continuous process of 'Becoming' provides a strong, coherent magical system.",
