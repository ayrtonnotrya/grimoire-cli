  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book does not present a single, overarching magical 'system' in the manner of a structured grimoire or a defined esoteric tradition. Instead, it serves as an extensive compendium of individual, largely pragmatic, and often localized magical, healing, and divinatory practices. The 'magic' described is overwhelmingly folk magic, deeply embedded in a syncretic worldview that blends ancient animistic and pagan beliefs with elements of Orthodox Christianity. The underlying philosophy suggests an animistic understanding of the world, where spirits (of the dead, nature, and household), celestial bodies, and common objects possess inherent magical qualities that can be influenced or directed through specific ritual actions, spoken formulas (баяния), offerings, and sympathetic correspondences. The focus is on practical, everyday concerns: personal health, communal well-being, agricultural success, and protection from malevolent entities or forces. The efficacy of these practices relies heavily on tradition, belief, and the precise performance of prescribed actions and words.",
    "tools": [
      "Natural Elements: Water (especially holy or flowing water), earth (from graves or specific spots), fire, smoke, various plants (herbs, specific trees like willow, hawthorn, garlic, wormwood), and animal parts/products (eggs, milk, blood, bones, fur, feathers from specific birds).",
      "Household Items: Iron objects (shovels, tools, nails), mirrors, threads, salt, bread, dishes, clothing, knots, and personal items of individuals involved.",
      "Religious Symbols: Crosses, icons, church bells, candles (though often adapted and integrated into folk practices, sometimes even against official church doctrine).",

    "rituals": [
      "Healing Rituals: Using herbal remedies, blessed water, earth, fire, and incantations to cure physical ailments (fever, rheumatism, skin conditions) and psychological distress ('fear' or 'уплах'), often involving ritual washing, application of poultices, or drinking charmed liquids.",
      "Protective Magic: Employing various actions and objects to ward off evil, illness, bad luck, and malevolent entities. Examples include rattling iron objects around the house, wearing specific amulets, tying protective knots, and using certain plants or animal parts.",

    "relevance": "This work is a crucial primary source for the study of folk magic, ethnology, and the history of religion in the Balkans. It provides a granular view of practical, grassroots magical and spiritual practices, demonstrating the persistence and adaptation of pre-Christian beliefs within a Christian framework. Unlike ceremonial grimoires, this collection illuminates the daily, pragmatic application of magic by common people for health, protection, love, and agricultural prosperity. Its meticulous documentation offers invaluable data for comparative studies in European folkloristics and the broader academic understanding of magical traditions outside of established Western esoteric currents.",
    "target_audience": "Ethnographers, folklorists, cultural historians, scholars of religion, anthropologists, and practitioners interested in traditional European folk magic, animistic beliefs, and the historical development of popular magical practices. It also serves as a vital resource for those studying the specific cultural heritage of Bulgaria and the Kyustendil region."
