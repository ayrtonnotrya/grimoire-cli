  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The Feri Tradition, as presented in SubVert, is an experiential, transformative magical system centered on direct interaction with deities ('Old Ones,' 'Lover Gods,' specific goddesses like Nimüe) and profound self-realization. It cultivates an 'Otherness' that distinguishes practitioners from ordinary mortals, encouraging a deep connection to both the visible and invisible worlds. Key to its practice is developing 'psychic muscles' for energy manipulation (e.g., Blue Fire), engaging in trance-possession for direct divine communication, and understanding the 'Black Heart' as a core of primal power and stability. The system emphasizes an ongoing process of 'Becoming,' where personal experience and intuition are paramount, often leading to radical self-transformation.",

    "relevance": "SubVert: Below the Green offers a rare, insider perspective into the Feri Tradition, a distinct current within modern Witchcraft and Western Esotericism. Its collection of articles, poems, and discussions provides authentic insights into Feri philosophy, ethical considerations (e.g., sacrifice, secrecy), and practical engagement with deities and the 'Otherworld.' The zine's exploration of concepts like 'Otherness,' the Black Heart, and the experiential nature of magic positions it as a highly relevant resource for those seeking to understand the living, evolving traditions of occultism beyond academic abstractions. The inclusion of diverse topics, from Yezidi lore to Poetic Terrorism, further illustrates the syncretic and individualistic tendencies within contemporary esoteric practice.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of practitioners and serious students of the Feri Tradition, individuals engaged in modern Witchcraft, and those with a deep interest in Western Esotericism and occult philosophy. It appeals to those who value direct, often intense, spiritual experience over dogma, are open to diverse magical influences, and seek to understand the nuances of a highly personal yet tribally connected magical path. Additionally, it could appeal to researchers of new religious movements, counter-cultural spirituality, and the sociological aspects of esoteric communities."
