  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The core practical system presented is a methodology for structured Tarot divination using specialized card layouts. Each 'spread' is a unique configuration of a specific number of cards, with each position assigned a precise interpretive meaning. The practitioner's operative process involves: 1) identifying the querent's specific question or situation, 2) selecting the most appropriate spread from the compendium that aligns with the inquiry's domain (e.g., career, relationship, self-awareness), 3) performing the physical act of shuffling and laying out the cards according to the chosen spread's diagram, and 4) interpreting each card's meaning in conjunction with its assigned positional significance. This process aims to reveal hidden influences, potential outcomes, obstacles, and guidance, providing a structured narrative derived from the cards. The 'magic' lies in the intentional structuring of the reading, guiding the subconscious mind and connecting to deeper currents of information through symbolic resonance.",

For a magician, these spreads act as ready-made sigils or blueprints for divinatory operations, allowing for precise formulation of intent and structured interpretation, thereby enhancing the efficacy of scrying and informational magic.
