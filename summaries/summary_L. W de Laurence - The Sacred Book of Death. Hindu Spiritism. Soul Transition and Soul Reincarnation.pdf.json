The words spiritual, spiritualist, spiritualism, have a definite acceptation; to give them a new one, in order to apply them to the doctrines set forth by spirits, would be to multiply the causes of amphibology, already so numerous. Strictly speaking, Spiritualism is the opposite of Materialism; every one is a Spiritualist who believes that there is in him something more than matter, but it does not follow that he believes in the existence of spirits, or in their communication with the visible world. Instead, therefore, of the words SPIRITUAL, SPIRITUALISM, employed in these writings to designate this latter belief, the words SPIRITIST, SPIRITISM, which, by their form, indicate their origin and radical meaning, and have thus the advantage of being perfectly intelligible; and we (Ancient Hindu Priests) reserve the words spiritualism, spiritualist, for the expression of the meaning attached to them by common acceptation.",

The learning of these guardians is far from the teachings of true Wisdom.

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "De Laurence's 'The Sacred Book of Death' is a pivotal text for understanding early 20th-century Western Esotericism's interaction with Eastern philosophies. It exemplifies the prevalent syncretism of the era, merging Hindu concepts of spiritism, reincarnation, and karma with a 'grimoire' style of practical magic. Its emphasis on operative occultism, complete with specific invocations and warnings, positions it as a significant work within the broader current of ceremonial magic manuals. The book's controversial commercialization and bold claims reflect the landscape of popular occultism during its publication, making it a valuable historical artifact for studying the dissemination and interpretation of esoteric knowledge in the West.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience, as explicitly stated, comprises 'Dr. de Laurence's Chelas (Disciples),' indicating individuals formally studying under his system or dedicated followers. However, its designation as a 'Students' Occult Edition' suggests a broader appeal to general occult students, seekers, and those interested in the 'mysteries' of death, the soul, and Eastern spiritual philosophies. The book caters to individuals seeking both theoretical understanding of Hindu Spiritism and practical, operative magical skills for personal spiritual advancement and interaction with the spirit world."
