  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The 'Ars Almadel' is an operative system of Solomonic angelic magic focused on invoking Chief Angels and their Princes from four celestial 'Altitudes' or 'Choras'. The system is distinguished by its use of a specific wax tablet (the Almadel), precisely inscribed with divine names and symbols, and four accompanying candles. Operations are timed according to the day of Sol and, crucially, the Sun's position within the zodiac, aligning the invocation with the specific ruling Angels of that period. The Angels are benevolent and appear readily if properly invoked, without the need for coercive measures typically found in Goetic practices. The aim is to gain wisdom, influence aspects of generation, increase/decrease, wealth/poverty, and other specific outcomes related to the Angels' domains.",

      "Once the Angel appears (as a mist/fog first, then in specific forms), place the incense vessel under the Almadel so the fume rises through its holes.",
      "The Angel will speak, asking the operator's desire. The operator must respond humbly, stating their requests for wisdom or specific outcomes, affirming that the Angel's office enables fulfillment if God wills it. If the Angel doesn't appear immediately, use the Golden Seal to make 3 or 4 marks on the candles.",

    {
      "text": "Note there is twelve Princes, beside those in the four Altitudes: and they distribute their offices amongst themselves, every one ruling thirty days every year. Now it will be in vain to call any of the Angels unless it be those that govern then, for every Chora or altitude hath its limited time, according to the twelve signs of the Zodiack; and in that Sign the Sun is in, that or those Angels that belong to that Sign hath the government [and should be invoked].",
      "page": "6"
    },
    {
      "text": "It is interesting to note that as the powers to be invoked has become progres- sively more exalted, the method of invocation becomes progressively simpler. One prepares to invoke a Goetic spirit as if for a minor magickal war; a single work of the Almadel can be accomplished before breakfast. This accords with the medieval idea that spirits who are servants of God want to assist mankind, and will readily come if properly called; the threats and force used on the Goetic spirits are not required for the higher spirits, and would in fact be an insult to them.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "The 'Ars Almadel' is a critical component of the 'Lemegeton', offering a distinct approach to angelic invocation compared to the more commonly known 'Goetia'. It represents a 'white magic' tradition within grimoires, emphasizing hierarchical celestial powers, cooperation with divine servants, and a less confrontational operative style. Its detailed instructions for constructing the Almadel and aligning operations with zodiacal periods provide a sophisticated system of celestial magic, influencing later Hermetic and Golden Dawn currents. The afterword's clarification of the Altitudes' seasonal/zodiacal nature significantly enhances the understanding of its underlying cosmological framework, making it highly relevant for practitioners seeking a gentler, more harmonically aligned form of angelic conjuration.",
    "target_audience": "Practicing magicians, occultists, and scholars of Western Esotericism, particularly those interested in Solomonic magic, grimoire traditions, angelic evocation, and astrological timing in ritual work. It is suitable for those who have a foundational understanding of ceremonial magic and are looking for a system focused on benevolent celestial entities and the acquisition of wisdom or specific blessings."
