      "definition": "Joy, happiness, or cheerfulness, considered a supreme act of Divine worship. It is essential for fulfilling Mitzvot properly, gives completeness to Mitzvah, and serves as a means to overcome 'atzvut' (dejection). It should be joined with 'yirah' (fear and awe of G-d)."

    {
      "term": "Hitlahavut",
      "definition": "Fervor and ardor, or ecstasy, in Divine service. It is an ideal state achievable through the practice of Mitzvot and requires tempering with 'yirah' (fear) to avoid losing meticulousness in obligations."

      "term": "Devekut",
      "definition": "Attachment or cleaving unto G-d. It is a goal of Jewish life, achieved through Torah study and Mitzvot observance. A permanent state of perfect devekut is humanly impossible on its own; it requires practicing G-d's attributes through action."
