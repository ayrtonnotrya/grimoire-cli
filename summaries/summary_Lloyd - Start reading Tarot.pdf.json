  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system is a streamlined method for conducting a 'Celtic Cross' tarot reading using only the 22 Major Arcana cards. It is designed for beginners to achieve proficiency rapidly. The core operative principle involves intentionally structuring the deck to represent the 'book of life' (numeric order 0-XXI) before the client imprints their query through shuffling. Interpretation is then a precise cross-referencing process of the revealed card with its designated position in the spread, leading to a narrative 'story' for the client.",

      "The client's focused concentration during shuffling, seen as a vital component for imprinting their query onto the 'book of life' (deck)."

    "rituals": [
      "Prepare the Major Arcana deck: All 22 Major Arcana cards must be placed in traditional numeric order (0-XXI), face down, to represent the 'book of life'.",
      "Client Shuffling: Hand the pre-ordered deck (face down, traditionally with the left hand) to the client. Instruct them to concentrate on their question while shuffling until they feel 'happy' that the cards reflect their current circumstances.",
      "Card Layout: Retrieve the shuffled deck. Place the top card upright as Position 1. Place the next card on top and across Position 1 as Position 2, forming a central cross. Then, place the next cards upright in numerical positions 3-10 around the central cross, following the specified layout diagram (page 8).",
      "Card Turning and Interpretation: Turn over foundation cards (1 and 2) face up simultaneously. Then, turn over the remaining cards individually in numerical order (3-10). For each card, locate its meaning by navigating to its Roman numeral page in the book and then finding the interpretation specific to its position number in the Celtic Cross spread.",
      "Final Summary: After interpreting each card individually and its position, combine all the meanings to form an 'overall story or pattern of events' that relates to the client's current circumstances, creating a comprehensive summary of the reading."

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant for entry-level practitioners in Western Esotericism, specifically tarot. It de-mystifies the initial learning phase, offering a practical, step-by-step guide to a foundational spread. Its focus on the Major Arcana aligns with many traditional and modern systems that prioritize these cards for core spiritual and life lessons, making it a good starting point before delving into the complexities of the Minor Arcana. By condensing '35 years experience,' it aims to provide effective, 'proven' methods, which is valuable in a field often saturated with abstract or overly complex beginner materials. The author's dismissal of 'reverse meanings' for beginners, while potentially controversial among some traditionalists, aligns with a more intuitive and less rigid approach, making the system more accessible.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience is explicitly 'tarot beginners' who want to learn quickly and efficiently ('in the fast track straight away'). It is designed for individuals who possess a Major Arcana tarot deck and are willing to follow a structured system before relying solely on intuition. It also appeals to those seeking a 'no nonsense' approach, valuing practicality over exhaustive theoretical discourse. The author advises against readings for those under 18, emotionally unstable, or with strong religious beliefs, indicating a responsible, albeit pragmatic, approach to client care within the esoteric context."
