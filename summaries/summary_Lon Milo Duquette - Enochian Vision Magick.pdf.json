This process is seen as a personal transformation, mirroring Dee and Kelley's own journey. The operative stage involves invoking angels from the Elemental Tablets (Watchtowers) and systematically scrying through the 30 Aethyrs to access different levels of divine consciousness. The method relies on Enochian Calls (Keys) and the proper pronunciation of angelic names, with a strong emphasis on diligent record-keeping of all visions and experiences.",
