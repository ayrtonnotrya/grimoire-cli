The emphasis is on a psychological and philosophical shift, aligning oneself with Luciferian principles. The 'commands' (XIII) suggest a direct ethical reorientation.

It directly engages with themes of rebellion, self-empowerment, and the redefinition of 'good' and 'evil' within a magical framework. Its historical claims, though unsubstantiated, place it within a lineage of grimoire traditions.",

Academics specializing in occultism, comparative religion, and the history of magic would also find it relevant for its thematic content and purported origins."
