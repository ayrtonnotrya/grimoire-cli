    "description": "The book outlines a system of \"low magick,\" focusing on personal energy, intention, and natural correspondences to effect change. It emphasizes an ethical framework (Wiccan Rede, threefold law) and self-responsibility. The operative side involves a preparatory phase (ritual baths, grounding, consecration, magickal name), a ritual phase (casting a magick circle, invoking deities/elements/entities, building and directing a \"cone of power\"), and an aftermath (recording, cleaning, giving back to Earth). The system is highly adaptable for solitaire practitioners, allowing for personalized rituals and self-study.",
