      "summary": "Presents Irwin's refined causal model, which posits that paranormal belief is activated by contextual stress, leading to feelings of vulnerability, loss of personal control, and anxiety. This activates existing paranormal beliefs and behaviors (e.g., divination via I Ching) within a specific context, driven by a need for environmental mastery. The model also touches upon early experiences with diminished control as a predisposing factor."

      "text": "The scientific establishment nevertheless [that is, despite observational theories of psi] continues to regard psi as an inherent impossibility. Be that as it may, the fact remains that some other paranormal beliefs do not implicate scientifically impossible processes. Many of the metaphysical beliefs of spiritism and religion are not a literal violation of scientific tenets. The existence of spirits and of heaven, for example, is not precluded by science. It is therefore not appropriate to define paranormal beliefs in terms of the contravention of scientific principles by paranormal phenomena.",

      "text": "a proposition that has not been empirically attested to the satisfaction of the scientific establishment but is generated within the nonscientific community and eventually endorsed by people who might normally be expected by their society to be capable of rational thought and reality testing. For these people, the belief is phenomenologically a part of their sense of reality and truth rather than 'a proposition they endorse'. Like other types of belief, a paranormal belief will be either intuitive or reflective; will have cognitive, affective and (sometimes) behavioural components; will be distinct from a value or simple statement of preference; will be relatively stable and thus somewhat resistant to the influence of counterargument; and will be dimensional, that is, marked by various degrees of endorsement between the poles of extreme scepticism and extreme gullibility.",
