  "central_thesis": "This volume contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion of magic and ritual power across the ancient Near East, Judaism, Greco-Roman antiquity, and early Christianity, including Coptic and Islamic Egypt. It emphasizes interdisciplinary approaches, issues of definition and taxonomy, and the understanding of 'magic' as 'ritual power', challenging traditional negative evaluations.",

      "chapter_title": "Part One: New Texts of Magic and Ritual Power",
      "summary": "This section presents the editio princeps and new interpretations of four ancient magical texts: P. Berol. 17202 (a 4th-century papyrus formulary with Christian liturgical exorcism, pagan invocations, erection spell, and sacred stele), two papyri with formulae for divination (PGM XXIVa and LXXVII), an early Christian gold lamella for headache (2nd-century, possibly Hellenistic Jewish-Christian), and a 7th-century Coptic limestone with gospel and apostle names for ritual power."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Part Two: Definitions and Theory",
      "summary": "Five essays address the theoretical foundations of magic and ritual. Topics include the philosophical debate on 'thought (belief)' versus 'action (ritual)' in defining magic, a historical survey of pre-Augustinian and Augustinian theories of magic, an analysis of the 'poetics of the magical charm' focusing on the power of words, a cross-cultural taxonomy of 'magicians' based on ritual expertise dynamics, and a survey of modern approaches to the study of magic, aiming to move beyond negative evaluations."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Part Three: The Ancient Near East",
      "summary": "This section comprises four essays examining magic and ritual in ancient Mesopotamian, Hittite, Canaanite, and Israelite contexts. It includes discussions on Hittite rituals for 'dividing a god' (creating multiple cult centers for the same deity), Mesopotamian 'transferal' rituals for ailments, the use of ritual pits and pig sacrifices in Hittite cult for fertility and purification, and an analysis of Deuteronomy 18 to distinguish Canaanite magic from Israelite religion, highlighting rhetorical strategies of taboo."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Part Four: Judaism",
      "summary": "Three essays explore aspects of magic within Judaism. Themes include the Talmudic rejection of magic, emphasizing public proclamation versus secretive ritual, shamanic initiatory death and resurrection in the Hekhalot literature as an experience of personal disintegration and reintegration, and the influence of ancient sacrificial cult imagery on Jewish magic, particularly how divine names and ritual accessibility transform Temple rituals for individual concerns."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Part Five: Greek and Roman Antiquity",
      "summary": "Five essays analyze magical texts and practices from Greek and Roman antiquity. These cover the ethnic origins of a Roman-era philtrokatadesmos (PGM IV 296-434) as an amalgam of Greek and Semitic practices with Egyptian features, the roles of sacrifice in the Greek Magical Papyri, recipe ingredients in Greco-Roman magical materials (exotic substances, 'voces magicae'), the ancient Greek reputation of Thessaly for sorcery, and the debate between Iamblichus and Porphyry on 'speech acts' and the efficacy of foreign versus Greek divine names in achieving spiritual ascent."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Part Six: Early Christianity and Islam",
      "summary": "This section contains three essays on magic and ritual power in early Christianity and Islam. Topics include the Virgin Mary's prayer to dissolve chains in Coptic magic, examining its functions and relationship with Coptic church rituals; the figure of Simon Magus, analyzing differing early Christian portrayals of him as a heretic and magician to understand 'magic' versus 'magician' terms; and the continuity of ancient Egyptian execration magic in Coptic and Islamic Egypt, tracing its mechanics and transformations across millennia."

    {
      "term": "Magic as Ritual Power",
      "definition": "A foundational premise of the volume, asserting that magic is best understood as a form of ritual power, often indistinguishable from or intertwined with religion, rather than a separate, inherently false category."

    {
      "term": "Definition and Taxonomy of Magic",
      "definition": "The critical scholarly endeavor to clarify what constitutes 'magic' versus 'religion' or 'science', acknowledging the arbitrary and context-dependent nature of such labels throughout history and across cultures."

      "term": "Historiolae",
      "definition": "Narrative elements or exemplary models, often derived from myths or historical events, incorporated into magical spells to impart power or persuasive force to the ritual, functioning as a performative transmission of power."
    },
    {
      "term": "Voces Magicae",
      "definition": "Strange, often incomprehensible, 'meaningless' words or sounds used in magical charms. These are understood to lack lexical meaning in human communication but are believed to refer to or help create a 'radically different world' or transcend normal language, often generated through processes of repetition, variation, and conscious 'alienation' from normal words."

    {
      "term": "Ritual Expertise",
      "definition": "The specialized knowledge and ability of individuals to construct and perform rituals and amulets, often involving the synthesis of local materials and 'official' symbols.

      "term": "Cultural Exchange/Syncretism",
      "definition": "The dynamic historical process of combining, adapting, and recombining features from different cultures (e.g., Greek, Semitic, Egyptian) in magical practices and beliefs, challenging simplistic notions of 'pure' ethnic origins for magical traditions."
