Moffatt (Shetat), celebrating her enduring influence and embodying Setian principles of Remanifestation and Xeper. Concurrently, it offers a foundational exposition of Setian ethics, defining the 'true' Black Magician's path as one of rigorous self-knowledge, continuous evolution, and responsible engagement with both the self and the world, contrasting it with common societal misconceptions of Satanism.",

This includes cultivating faithfulness to oneself, pursuing knowledge broadly without limitation, discerning truth from falsehood, and engaging with society from an 'initiated perspective' rather than detaching entirely.

    "relevance": "This issue is highly relevant for understanding the internal culture and philosophical underpinnings of the Temple of Set during the late 1980s. It provides a nuanced view of Setian 'Black Magic' as a path of self-directed evolution and ethical responsibility, moving beyond simplistic 'evil' stereotypes. The emphasis on Xeper and Remanifestation highlights the Setian focus on individual sovereignty and post-mortem continuity of consciousness, distinct from traditional occult views on immortality. The 'Satanic Ethics' article is a practical guide for practitioners, offering a structured approach to self-mastery within an esoteric context.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience is existing members and initiates of the Temple of Set, particularly those seeking guidance on Setian philosophy, ethics, and personal evolution. It also appeals to individuals interested in the organizational history and internal dynamics of modern Western esoteric orders, specifically Setianism, and those wishing to understand its practical and ethical dimensions from an authoritative internal perspective."
