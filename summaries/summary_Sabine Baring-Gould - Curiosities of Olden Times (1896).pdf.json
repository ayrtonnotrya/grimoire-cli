And yet the correlations of general custom—of mourning fashions, lead us to the inexorable conclusion that in its inception the practice had quite a different signification from that now attributed to it, nay more, that it is solely because its primitive meaning has been absolutely forgotten, and an entirely novel significance given to it, that mourning is still employed after a death.",

    "relevance": "The book's relevance to Western Esotericism and Occultism is primarily historical and tangential. It chronicles pre-scientific beliefs, folklore, and superstitious practices that might be considered precursors or parallel manifestations of 'magical thinking.' It does not present or teach operative esoteric systems, but rather offers an academic, anecdotal survey of historical curiosities that sometimes touch upon themes related to the occult from a non-practitioner perspective.",
    "target_audience": "Historians of social customs, folklore, and pre-modern beliefs; general readers interested in unusual historical anecdotes and curiosities. It is not intended for practitioners seeking instructions for esoteric or magical work, nor for deep philosophical inquiry into occult traditions."
