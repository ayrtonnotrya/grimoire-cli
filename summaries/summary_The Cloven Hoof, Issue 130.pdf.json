  "practical_system": {
    "description": "As conveyed through the collective testimonials, the practical system of LaVeyan Satanism centers on individual self-actualization and the deliberate application of philosophical tenets to achieve real-world results. It involves embracing one's 'carnal nature,' rejecting hypocrisy and victimhood, and living by 'self-made laws.' Practitioners are encouraged to develop personal strength, apply 'Lesser Magic' (psychological manipulation and strategic social interaction) and 'Greater Magic' (focused ritual for emotional release or self-transformation), and create 'Total Environments' to reinforce their will. The emphasis is on tangible, earthly success and personal fulfillment, making magic a pragmatic tool for living a vital and indulgent life, as exemplified by Anton LaVey himself.",

For scholars, it offers primary source material on the internal discourse and identity consolidation within a modern occult organization during a critical period.",
