    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant as it addresses a significant gap in Western esoteric literature by providing practical, user-friendly techniques for inner journeying, which are often presented in overly complex or abstract ways. It synthesizes diverse traditions (Qabala, Alchemy, Hermeticism, Eastern practices) into a coherent, operative system, making advanced concepts accessible for self-initiation. Its emphasis on direct experience and preparation for conscious death resonates with contemporary interests in practical spirituality and confronting existential questions.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes beginners and intermediate students of Western Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic who seek direct, experiential knowledge of non-material realities. It is particularly suited for those interested in lucid dreaming, astral projection, the Body of Light, and a conscious approach to death and spiritual development, even without extensive prior knowledge or a background in complex ritualistic traditions. Practitioners of Qabala and Alchemy will find specific techniques and contextualization valuable."
