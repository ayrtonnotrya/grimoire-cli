It aims to teach practitioners to consciously control their minds to reshape their reality and achieve 'illumination and power' through verifiable experience.",

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The New Hermetics is a 10-level progressive system of self-initiation and practical instruction, mapping to the Sephiroth of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. It operates by first teaching the practitioner to induce an 'altered state' of consciousness, then providing specific 'tools' and 'rituals' to manipulate internal representations (via NLP submodalities), emotional states (via anchoring and pranayama), core beliefs, and archetypal energies. The system aims to give the practitioner conscious control over their mind to reshape their inner and outer reality, progressing from basic self-mastery and emotional control to advanced manifestation, archetypal invocation, and ultimately, cosmic consciousness. Emphasis is placed on direct experience and verifiable results.",
