  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant for contemporary esoteric practitioners, particularly those in divination, who seek to professionalize their skills. In a landscape where spiritual practices are increasingly monetized, Jette's work provides a crucial bridge between esoteric knowledge and entrepreneurial pragmatism. It fills a significant gap in occult literature by offering structured business advice, ethical guidelines, and practical strategies tailored specifically for esoteric service providers. Its focus on legal, financial, and marketing aspects is invaluable, elevating the perception of divination from a hobby to a legitimate profession. It implicitly acknowledges that manifesting a sustainable esoteric career is a form of practical magic in itself.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of aspiring and established professional tarot readers, intuitive consultants, and esoteric teachers. It is also highly beneficial for anyone involved in 'New Age' or spiritual service businesses (e.g., astrologers, energy healers, coaches) who wish to formalize their practice, improve client relations, navigate legal and financial complexities, and expand their market reach. The book assumes a foundational understanding of tarot, shifting the focus to the business application rather than core divinatory techniques."
