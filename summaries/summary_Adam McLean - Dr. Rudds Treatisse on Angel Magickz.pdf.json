The treatise offers deep insight into the Rosicrucian context of angelic invocation and the syncretic nature of early modern occultism, integrating Qabalah, astrology, and geomancy. Its meticulously detailed instructions and comprehensive directories of spirits make it an indispensable resource for advanced ritual work.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of advanced practitioners and dedicated academic researchers in Western Esotericism, occultism, and magic. This text is not suitable for beginners due to the inherent complexity of the material, the assumed familiarity with Qabalistic and astrological correspondences, and the potential spiritual and psychological challenges associated with commanding spirits. Individuals with a strong background in historical grimoires, angelic magic, planetary magic, and the works of figures like John Dee, Edward Kelley, and Johannes Trithemius will find this book particularly valuable and rewarding."
