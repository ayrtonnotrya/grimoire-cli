It begins with bell tolling and blood-anointing the sigil, emphasizing connection with other participants. It details the daily lighting of cumulative black candles, the process of deep visualization where Nina Negra, in Grim Reaper form, destroys a specific unwanted aspect (written on parchment), and a final meditation. The seventh day culminates with burning the parchment paper in the cauldron using the seventh candle's flame, visualizing Nina Negra's complete destruction of all written aspects, and scattering the ashes in nature."

    "description": "The system is a seven-day solitary ritual focused on personal destruction and rebirth, facilitated by Nina Negra. Each day involves lighting a new candle (cumulatively), focusing on one specific personal aspect to be 'destroyed', and visualizing Nina Negra actively severing or annihilating it with her scythe. The ritual culminates on the seventh day with a ceremonial burning of all written intentions in a cauldron, ritually releasing the 'destroyed' aspects to nature.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This ritual is highly relevant to contemporary occultism, particularly practitioners engaged in shadow work, psychological magic, and deity-specific workings. It provides a structured method for confronting existential fears (death, personal limitations) and leveraging chthonic energies for self-actualization. The explicit focus on 'destroying' unwanted aspects for transformation places it within a lineage of transformative magic. Its 'OPEN PROJECT' nature also reflects modern occult trends towards experimentalism and shared experiential knowledge.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience consists of experienced occult practitioners familiar with Western Esotericism, particularly those interested in death currents, chthonic deities, and Santa Muerte veneration. The requirement of blood anointing, the intensity of the visualizations, and the emphasis on deep psychological transformation suggest it is not suitable for beginners but rather for those comfortable with intense magical work and self-exploration."
