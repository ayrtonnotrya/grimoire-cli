  "practical_system": {
    "description": "D. J. Conway's 'Celtic Magic' outlines a syncretic operative magical system blending ancient Celtic paganism and modern Wiccan elements. It is grounded in a deep reverence for Nature, elemental spirits, and a pantheon of Celtic deities (including the Triple Goddess and Horned God). The system emphasizes self-initiation, personal responsibility, and continuous learning, aiming to empower practitioners to manifest desires, heal, protect, and gain wisdom. It functions by establishing a circuit of communication with 'energy pools' from other planes through ritual, symbols, visualization, and controlled emotion, all performed within a consecrated magical circle. The timing of rituals is crucial, often aligning with Moon phases and seasonal Sabbats. Ethical practice, encapsulated in 'Do what you will if you harm no being,' is a core tenet, encouraging positive personal and collective outcomes.",
