      "chapter_title": "Introduction: Reading Mysteries: The Origins of Scholarship on Jewish Mysticism",
      "summary": "This chapter surveys the history of Jewish mysticism from biblical precursors to modern times, focusing on the pivotal role of Gershom Scholem in establishing the academic study of Kabbalah against earlier dismissive attitudes.

      "chapter_title": "1 Ancient Jewish Mysticism",
      "summary": "Michael D. Swartz explores early Jewish mysticism (1st-7th centuries CE), including rabbinic esoteric traditions (the pardes story), Hekhalot and Merkavah literature (heavenly palaces, divine chariot visions, angelic conjurations), Sefer Yetsirah (creation via Hebrew letters and sefirot), and Shi'ur Qomah (anthropomorphic descriptions of God). The chapter discusses these texts as records of visionary experiences and rituals, and debates their classification as 'mysticism' within the academic context."

      "chapter_title": "2 The Zohar: Masterpiece of Jewish Mysticism",
      "summary": "Eitan P. Fishbane analyzes the Zohar, a central text of Kabbalah, discussing its 13th-century Spanish origins and pseudepigraphic attribution to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. He details its theological system of ten sefirot and its dual genres of mystical midrash and fictional narrative, exploring the Zohar's portrayal of inner divine life, gendered dynamics, and the cosmic struggle between good and evil. The chapter emphasizes how modern scholarship has refined understanding of its complex authorship and literary nature."

      "chapter_title": "3 Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia and the Prophetic Kabbalah",
      "summary": "Elliot R. Wolfson examines Abraham Abulafia (13th century), a pioneer of ecstatic or prophetic Kabbalah. The chapter details his meditational practices involving letter permutation (gematria) and divine names for prophetic illumination and ecstatic union. It explores Abulafia's typological distinctions of Kabbalah, his messianic claims, and his complex, often polemical, relationship with Christianity, highlighting his ethnocentric views on the transmission of esoteric knowledge."

      "chapter_title": "4 New Approaches to the Study of Kabbalistic Life in 16th-Century Safed",
      "summary": "Lawrence Fine explores the 16th-century Kabbalistic community in Safed, a hub of mystical activity after the Spanish expulsion. He broadens the scholarly focus beyond theological ideas to include social aspects (havurot, communal life), autobiographical and biographical literature (Joseph Karo, Hayyim Vital), ethical concerns (musar ha-Kabbalit), ritual innovations (Kabbalat Shabbat, tikkunim), and the active role and visionary experiences of women within this mystical environment."

      "chapter_title": "5 Mystical Messianism: From the Renaissance to the Enlightenment",
      "summary": "Matt Goldish traces Jewish messianic movements from the 13th to 18th centuries, emphasizing the deep intertwining of Kabbalah and messianic hopes. He discusses the impact of historical events like the Spanish expulsion, the influence of the Zohar and Abulafia, and details the Sabbatean movement led by Shabbatai Zevi and Nathan of Gaza. The chapter explores Sabbatean kabbalistic theology, antinomianism, and subsequent movements like Frankism, contextualizing them within broader Christian and Muslim messianic waves and historiographical debates."

    {
      "chapter_title": "6 Hasidism: Mystical and Nonmystical Approaches to Interpreting Scripture",
      "summary": "Shaul Magid examines Hasidism as a modern mystical movement, analyzing scholarly debates regarding its relation to classical Kabbalah. He focuses on Ya’akov Yosef Katz of Polnoy's 'Bible revolution,' arguing that Hasidism re-centered Scripture through devotional readings, making biblical narratives relevant to individual spiritual life. This approach, which often questioned the literal relevance of biblical stories, served to defend the Bible's eternal nature against modern critiques and contributed to Hasidism's distinct spiritual identity."

      "chapter_title": "7 Christian Kabbalah",
      "summary": "Allison P. Coudert discusses the often-marginalized field of Christian Kabbalah, from Raymond Lull to Francis Mercury van Helmont. She highlights how Christian thinkers adopted and adapted Jewish Kabbalistic ideas (sefirot, tikkun, Hebrew language) to reinterpret Christian doctrines, promote tolerance, and contribute to the scientific revolution. The chapter argues for Christian Kabbalah’s significant role in fostering optimistic views of humanity and progress in Western thought, often challenging traditional theological frameworks."

      "chapter_title": "8 Kabbalah at the Turn of the 21st Century",
      "summary": "Jody Myers analyzes the contemporary revival of Kabbalah in North America, detailing its pathways (Theosophy, New Age, academic scholarship, Jewish outreach, Kabbalah Centre) and reasons for its allure. These include offering alternative theologies (nontheistic, immanent, gender-inclusive), nonliteral scriptural interpretations, new worship forms, perceived scientific knowledge, a positive outlook (tikkun), and specific answers to the problem of evil (kelippot, reincarnation). The chapter notes the phenomenon of Kabbalah's widespread popularization beyond traditional circles."

    {
      "chapter_title": "9 Gender in Jewish Mysticism",
      "summary": "Hava Tirosh-Samuelson surveys academic scholarship on gender and the feminine in Kabbalah, particularly focusing on the Shekhinah symbolism. She traces interpretations by Scholem (Gnostic influence), Schäfer (Marian cult influence), Wolfson (androcentric, phallocentric), and Idel (culture of eros, egalitarian). The chapter highlights ongoing debates on whether Kabbalah supports or undermines gender equality, discussing how feminist and psychoanalytic theories are applied to its study, and emphasizing the complexity and conflicting interpretations within Kabbalistic texts regarding the feminine."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Epilogue: Kabbalah and Contemporary Judaism",
      "summary": "Pinchas Giller reflects on the changing academic and public perceptions of Kabbalah. He critiques earlier scholarly narratives, particularly Scholem’s 'response to trauma' thesis, by integrating recent scholarship challenging notions of single authorship for the Zohar and the confinement of Kabbalah to the historical past. The chapter emphasizes the persistence and evolution of living Kabbalistic traditions (Chabad, Breslav, Renewal) and calls for academia to engage more deeply with these contemporary manifestations, acknowledging the dynamic interpretive impulse within Judaism."
