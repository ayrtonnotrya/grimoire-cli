Success is predicated on spiritual purity, self-mastery, adherence to natural/divine laws, and the understanding of universal sympathies and antipathies.

Its enduring popularity reflects a persistent interest in comprehensive magical manuals and the integration of diverse spiritual traditions. It continues to be relevant for understanding the development of modern occultism and its popular dissemination.",
