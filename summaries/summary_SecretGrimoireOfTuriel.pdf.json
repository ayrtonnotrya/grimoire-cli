A detailed invocation specifically for Jupiterian spirits (Sachiel, Castiel, Asasiel) is provided, requesting the sending of messengers (Tarjel, Coniel, Babiel) and the appearance of a spirit (Setchiel, Chedustaniel, Corael) in a benign angelic form to fulfill requests."

It then details the process of eliciting a binding oath from the spirit, ensuring its future cooperation and the confirmation of its unique 'character' (sigil). The ritual concludes with a 'Licence to Depart,' granting the spirit permission to return to its sphere until called again."

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "The Secret Grimoire of Turiel stands as a notable example within the modern grimoire tradition, demonstrating a clear continuity with historical ceremonial magic texts. Its detailed instructions for planetary invocation, specific spirit hierarchies, and emphasis on preparatory purification rituals offer a structured pathway for practitioners. The grimoire's unique claim of being a rewritten and singular manuscript from a 16th-century Latin original, re-presented in the mid-20th century, makes it a curious artifact for historical and textual analysis within esotericism. It shows how traditional models of spirit interaction, particularly those seeking wisdom and assistance from specific planetary intelligences, are re-interpreted and re-affirmed.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of advanced students and practitioners of Western Esotericism, particularly those specializing in ceremonial magic, grimoire traditions, and planetary magic. It is suitable for occultists who possess a foundational understanding of ritual structure, an ability to engage with lengthy prayers and divine names, and a willingness to undertake rigorous physical and spiritual preparations. Researchers of occult history and practitioners seeking a direct, operative system of spirit communication would also find this text highly relevant."
