Historically accurate terms include 'the trumps and the Fool', 'Papess'/'Popess', and suit names 'coins'/'staves'/'batons' before 'pentacles'/'wands'."

The document states there is no clear evidence for divinatory use until 'long after the cards were invented'. The word 'tarot' may derive from the Arab 'turuq' ('four ways')."

      "summary": "Playing cards were introduced to Europe (1375-1378) from Islamic Mamluk cards with suits like cups, swords, coins, and polo sticks. Jacquemin Gringonneur painted a deck for Charles VI of France in 1392. The Tarot itself first appears in northern Italy between 1420-1440 as costly, hand-painted decks used for complex games by the upper classes, with a structure similar to modern decks but varying Trump names/scoring. The earliest surviving full deck is identified as the Visconti-Sforza Tarocchi Deck (1422) by Bonifacio Bembo."

      "chapter_title": "Printing, Standardization, and Early Divinatory Links (15th-16th Century)",
      "summary": "Before 1480, French playing cards (hearts, clubs, spades, diamonds) emerged, sharing an ancestor but not descending from Tarot. The first literary mention of regular playing cards for divination occurred in 1487. The Gutenberg press in the 1500s enabled mass-printed Tarot, standardizing Trump names/numbers, making them affordable, and spreading them from Italy. The term 'tarocchi' (1530s) distinguished them from new 'triumphs' games. A 1589 Venice trial records an association between Tarot and witchcraft, with no further magical references until the 18th century. By the 16th century, the Marseilles Tarot was widely used."

      "summary": "'Le Monde Primitif' (1781) by Court de Gebelin and Comte de Mellet marks the first explicit connection of Tarot to occult/divination, Hebrew letters/Kabbalah, and Egyptian origins. The Ettellia Tarot deck (1788) was the first published specifically for divination, with radical designs. Eliphas Levi (1850s) popularized the Tarot-Kabbalah connection, establishing it as the main model for interpretation, and Paul Christian coined 'Major Arcana'/'Minor Arcana'. The Waite-Smith (Rider-Waite) deck (1909) by A.E. Waite and Pamela Coleman Smith (Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn) was the first with full illustrations on all suit cards, based on Golden Dawn symbolism, becoming foundational for modern divination. Waite also publicized the Celtic Cross spread. Aleister Crowley and Lady Frieda Harris designed the Thoth deck (1938-1943), published in 1969, featuring rich esoteric, Kabbalistic, astrological, and alchemical symbolism."
