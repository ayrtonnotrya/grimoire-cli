    "description": "This book is an academic edited volume comprising scholarly articles that analyze historical magical systems and traditions; it does not present a single, coherent, or directly actionable practical system for contemporary magical practice. Instead, it meticulously deconstructs and contextualizes historical rituals, spells, and magical texts from diverse ancient cultures, illustrating the principles and methods employed by magicians in antiquity and the medieval period. Readers gain theoretical insights into how magic was understood and practiced historically, but not a manual for direct application.",
