The emphasis on specific material components and detailed ritual instructions makes it a functional grimoire for operative magic. It asserts a strong underlying philosophy of mind-power, faith, and belief as essential drivers of magical efficacy, aligning with contemporary occult paradigms that integrate psychological and spiritual elements. The text’s practical focus on tangible results, coupled with a cautionary ethical note for offensive magic, makes it a pertinent resource for those seeking immediate, real-world magical intervention.",

The book also targets individuals with an existing belief in spiritual forces, mind-power, and the efficacy of ritual components, including those looking for methods to overcome perceived curses, bad luck, or the malevolent intentions of others."
