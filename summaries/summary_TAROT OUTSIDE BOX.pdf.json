    "description": "The practical system presented in 'Tarot Outside the Box' is a multi-layered approach to Tarot interpretation, designed to foster intuitive depth and nuanced understanding. It moves beyond a singular deck's symbolism, integrating comparative analysis across multiple decks, structured multi-deck readings, and a precise application of Elemental Dignities. The methodology encourages practitioners to actively engage with the cards through original spreads and creative writing, thereby cultivating a personal and adaptable interpretive framework. The core mechanism involves selecting multiple decks, drawing specific cards, and then systematically comparing and contrasting their visual and symbolic representations, often guided by the elemental interactions between cards. The system posits that deeper insights emerge from the synthesis of these varied perspectives rather than from isolated meanings.",
