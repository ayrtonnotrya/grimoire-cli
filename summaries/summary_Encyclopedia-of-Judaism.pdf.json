  "key_concepts": [
    {
      "term": "Kabbalah",
      "definition": "The mystical tradition within normative Judaism, relying on symbolic interpretation of the Torah. It involves concepts like Eyn Sof (God without limit) and Sefirot (10 emanations), used for meditation and understanding divine nature and cosmology. Emphasizes repairing the world (Tikkun Olam) and has influenced Hasidism. The study of Kabbalah is generally reserved for stable, learned scholars due to its complexity and spiritual danger, as exemplified by the story of Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues."
    },
    {
      "term": "Zohar",
      "definition": "The foundational and most influential text of Kabbalah, a 13th-century mystical work written in an artificial Aramaic blend of Babylonian Talmudic and Onkelos translation styles. Though traditionally ascribed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, it was most certainly written by Moses de León. It became central to Isaac Luria's teachings and Hasidism, providing rich mystical insights."
    },
    {
      "term": "Merkabah",
      "definition": "An ancient stream of Jewish mysticism inaugurated by the prophet Ezekiel's vision of God's divine chariot (Ezekiel 1). This tradition involves intense prayer, Torah study, meditation, and fasting, with the goal of spiritual ascent. It is associated with the 'hekhalot' (heavenly courts) literature from the 7th to 11th centuries C.E. Gershom Scholem links Merkabah to Kabbalah and theories of magic."
    },
    {
      "term": "Golem",
      "definition": "In Jewish lore, an artificial man created from earth by a highly trained Kabbalist using secret names of God. Golems are typically created to act as servants or protectors, but are often destroyed when their 'stupidity' makes them useless or when they threaten innocent lives, as in the famous legend of Rabbi Judah Loew of Prague protecting Jews from Christian mobs."
    },
    {
      "term": "Gematria",
      "definition": "A technique of textual interpretation, especially popular among Kabbalists, that assigns numerical values to Hebrew letters. Mystics use this system to find hidden meanings and establish relationships between words and concepts, often believing these connections exist on spiritual planes. For example, the Hebrew word 'chai' (life) has a numerical value of 18, leading to the tradition of giving monetary gifts in multiples of 18."
    },
    {
      "term": "Evil Eye",
      "definition": "A belief, originating in Babylonian culture and adopted into Jewish custom, that a malicious force or illness can be cast by an envious glance. To ward it off, practices include wearing amulets like the Hamsa, using red colors, salt, or reciting special verses. It is often linked to protecting vulnerable individuals, such as newborn babies, from jealousy or malevolent spirits like Lilith."
    },
    {
      "term": "Hamsa",
      "definition": "A hand-shaped amulet popular among Jews from Arab countries, believed to provide magical protection against the evil eye. Also referred to as the Hand of Miriam, sister of Moses, and often incorporates magical words or names. While some religious Jews view its use as superstitious, it is widely used as a symbol of Jewish identity and good wishes, appearing in homes and synagogues."
    },
    {
      "term": "Tikkun Olam",
      "definition": "'World repair' or 'mending the world.' In Kabbalistic tradition, particularly as interpreted by Isaac Luria, it refers to the mystic's role in restoring God's light to its divine source by performing pious acts (*mitzvot*) and separating the holy from the profane, thus contributing to the final redemption. In contemporary Judaism, it often denotes social or political action and community service."
    },
    {
      "term": "Divination",
      "definition": "The attempt to predict or divine the future by consulting spirits, departed souls, or other occult means. Judaism explicitly prohibits divination, considering it an abomination, as stated in Deuteronomy (18:10–12). Rabbinic dogma views it as false action that leads people away from God, though Maimonides paradoxically permitted using the Hebrew Bible for future prediction."
    },
    {
      "term": "Kapparah",
      "definition": "A ritual ceremony of atonement performed by many Jews on the day before Yom Kippur. It involves waving a rooster or hen (or money) over one's head three times while reciting verses, symbolically transferring sins to the fowl, which is then slaughtered and given to the poor. Rabbis have debated its validity, with some deeming it a pagan practice, while others, particularly Ashkenazim, recognize it as a valid form of atonement."
    },
    {
      "term": "Shabbatai Zvi",
      "definition": "A 17th-century Turkish Jew (1626-1676) who proclaimed himself the Messiah, gaining a worldwide following due to his charismatic personality and mystical fervor amidst the horrific persecutions of the time. His movement led to antinomian beliefs among some followers, who thought the coming of the Messiah meant the abandonment of Jewish law. His eventual conversion to Islam profoundly shocked and devastated the Jewish world, but also catalyzed later movements like Zionism."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system within Judaism, as presented in this encyclopedia, emphasizes adherence to ritual law (halakhah) interpreted by rabbis, combined with sincere devotion (kavanah) and ethical conduct. While explicitly prohibiting forbidden occult practices like divination and idolatry, it actively integrates mystical traditions such as Kabbalah and Hasidism. These traditions offer methods for individual spiritual transformation and contribute to the collective goal of 'world repair' (tikkun olam). The system involves engaging with sacred texts, participating in communal prayer, and performing good deeds and specific rituals to connect with the divine and foster holiness in daily life.",

  "relevant_quotes": [
    {
      "text": "Some rabbinic commentators are uncomfortable with God commanding Abraham to sacrifice his son. They instead assert that Abraham misunderstood what was being asked of him. While God did call upon him to take Isaac up to the mountain, according to these interpreters, God never asked him to slaughter Isaac, only to prepare him as a burnt offering (veha’alehu le’olah). Presumably, God wanted to see how Abraham would interpret the request, and what he would do in response to his interpretation. This interpretation pictures Abraham as confused and frustrated when he is told not to sacrifice his son. The MIDRASH says that God told Abraham: 'I did not tell you to slaughter him but rather to take him up to the top of the mountain. You have indeed taken him up. Now take him down again.' The point of this interpretation is that the biblical reader must learn how to interpret carefully what God wants, without ever doing harm in the process of learning from the TANAKH, the Hebrew Bible.",

      "text": "The word dybbuk comes from the HEBREW root davak, which means “to cleave.” The dybbuk or evil spirit would cleave to the body. The mystical literature of the KABBALAH describes how evil spirits can make the possessed individual commit sins. The dybbuk originally gained entry through illness, or because of a secret sin the possessed person committed. Some stories portray dybbuks as souls with unfinished business in this world. The mystics created an exorcism ceremony by means of which a holy man could order a dybbuk to leave the body it was possessing.",

      "text": "The Sefer Yetsirah (“Book of Creation” or “Book of Formation”) is the oldest HEBREW-language text of Jewish MYSTICISM extant today. It was probably written between the third and sixth centuries of the Common Era. Gershom SCHOLEM associates it with MERKABAH mystical literature and with theories of magic. In its brief 1,600 words, it focuses on issues of cosmology, exploring the elements of the world as expressed in the 10 primordial num bers and the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Each letter has secret meaning on three levels: the level of man, the level of celestial objects, and the level of time.",
      "page": "497"
    },
    {
      "text": "The rabbis over the centuries warned that if Jews performed God’s commandments, or mitzvot (see MITZVAH), without kavanah, as mere routine or habit, they might lose their effectiveness and might not be accepted by God. Individuals who did not cultivate kavanah in prayer and action were also more likely to stop observing these commandments.",
