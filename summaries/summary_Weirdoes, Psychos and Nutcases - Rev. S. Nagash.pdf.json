Examples include fabricated claims of being 'raped by Satan' to justify a 'Satanist' identity, asserting the 'devil' as their 'Holy Father,' misrepresenting the Left Hand Path (LHP) as 'dark' (when it is 'enlightening and about learning'), claiming control by Satan, or advocating animal/child sacrifice (which the author states is unnecessary for magick)."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "This text does not present a magical system with rituals or tools. Instead, it offers a practical system for discernment and self-protection within occult and spiritual communities. The system's 'mechanics' involve categorizing individuals based on their manipulative behaviors (e.g., seeking sympathy, pity, friendship, or attention) and their often exaggerated or misinformed claims regarding occult practices (e.g., being 'raped by Satan,' claiming the devil as 'Holy Father,' misrepresenting the LHP, or advocating for sacrifice). The operative side is the application of these classifications to identify and avoid individuals labeled as 'parasitic psi-vamps' to prevent emotional and psychological exploitation. The system implies that practitioners should be critical, question extraordinary claims, and understand genuine magical principles (e.g., LHP as enlightening, magick not requiring sacrifice) to protect themselves from such 'wackos, psychos, or nutcases'.",
