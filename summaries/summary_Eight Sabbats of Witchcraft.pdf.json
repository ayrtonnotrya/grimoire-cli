This involves understanding the seasonal significance, deities, and traditional folk customs associated with each Sabbat, and integrating them into contemporary ritual and celebration, often favoring older or astrologically precise dates over popularized calendar dates. The system promotes recognizing the cyclical nature of time and the interplay of light and darkness, death, and rebirth throughout the year, fostering a deeper, more informed practice.",
