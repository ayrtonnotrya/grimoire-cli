  "central_thesis": "The book's central thesis is that \"Old System Magic\" (Medieval Magic, Goetia, Theurgy) is a distinct, effective, and results-oriented practice, fundamentally different from and superior to \"New Age\" or modern ritual magic systems (like the Golden Dawn) for achieving tangible material and spiritual results. It emphasizes rigorous personal preparation, strict adherence to grimoire instructions, and the cultivation of a robust \"Subjective Synthesis\" and \"Will\" as the true sources of magical power, rather than mere symbolic or psychological exercises. The core message is that *work* and *efficacy* are paramount for success, and shortcuts or mixing systems lead to failure.",
