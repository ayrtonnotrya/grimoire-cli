    "description": "The core practical system centers on individual self-deification, or Xeper, achieved through rigorous self-analysis, critical thought, and deliberate action. It mandates grounding in the mundane world, precision of thought, and cultivating a unique, often humorous, perspective. Magical work is viewed as a means to refine the 'isolate self' and impose one's will, transitioning from mysticism to a 'science.' This involves specific practices like Enochian magic for self-integration and will manifestation, Essent for vital transformation, and Xem for purification and refining human potential. The Order of Horus emphasizes developing consciousness, action, and skills to transform the 'self' into the 'Self,' bridging noumenal and phenomenal realms. The system explicitly rejects collective identity and promotes relentless personal evolution.",
