  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book presents a practical system for Tarot reading centered on intuitive, image-based interpretation. The core mechanic involves discarding the need for memorized card meanings initially. Instead, the practitioner is instructed to 'look at the cards and say what you see,' allowing spontaneous associations and 'first hunches' to guide the interpretation. This process cultivates a direct, unmediated connection with the visual narrative of each card. The system is structured with a '2-hour' training period that focuses exclusively on this intuitive method through simple exercises. Progression involves applying this method to increasingly complex spreads, such as the E-Z Three Card, Celtic Cross, Seven Triplets, Horoscope, Five-By-Five, One-Year, and Horseshoe Spreads. Traditional card meanings are provided as a reference *after* the intuitive method has been cultivated, serving as supplementary guidance rather than the primary mode of interpretation. The underlying philosophy suggests that the querent's subconscious or the reader's intuition subtly influences the cards (linking to concepts like psychokinesis) to reflect relevant insights.",

Its focus on 'looking at the pictures' and 'first hunches' encourages a direct, unmediated engagement with the cards, fostering a personal connection that many find empowering.",
