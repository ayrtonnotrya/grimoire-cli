  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book presents a practical system for Wiccan practice centered on energy manipulation, visualization, and ritual design within an earth-based, polytheistic framework. It emphasizes personal responsibility, ethical conduct (Wiccan Rede, Threefold Law), and experiential learning. The system begins with foundational 'mental tools'—developing sensitivity to energy, mastering visualization for manifesting intent, and essential energy management techniques like grounding and shielding. These skills are then integrated into the construction of sacred space (the magical circle) and structured rituals, including calling the four elemental quarters and invoking the God and Goddess. Spellcraft is introduced as a method of 'causing change in conformance with will' through focused intent, energy raising (e.g., 'cone of power'), and the strategic use of magical correspondences.",
