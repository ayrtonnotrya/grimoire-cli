      "summary": "This section introduces Saint Expedite as a 'folk saint' revered for rapid solutions, distinct from officially canonized saints. It details his widespread veneration, particularly in New Orleans, and describes his traditional iconography: a Roman soldier holding a cross with 'HODIE' (today) and crushing a crow with 'CRAS' (tomorrow), symbolizing his defeat of delay.

      "chapter_title": "Working with Expedite",
      "summary": "This chapter provides practical guidance for setting up and maintaining a shrine dedicated to Saint Expedite. It specifies essential items such as a red cloth, an image or statue of the saint, red and gold candles (preferably seven or nine-day glass-encased), fresh water changed daily, a plate, and a vase. The importance of specific offerings, including pound cake (his favorite), red carnations, frankincense, myrrh, sandalwood, red wine, Roman coins, bread, and occasionally bourbon, is highlighted. Crucially, offerings are made as 'payment' only after a favour is granted, and the practitioner must uphold their end of the bargain. Spreading his name publicly is also noted as a way to gain his favour."

    {
      "chapter_title": "To Petition Saint Expedite",
      "summary": "Two primary methods for petitioning Saint Expedite are detailed. The first involves a direct, devotional approach at the shrine: lighting candles, setting out fresh water, reciting the Our Father once and Hail Mary three times, making the sign of the cross, and then kneeling to state a personal petition. The second method involves writing the request and promised offering on brown paper, signing it, folding it, placing it on a heatproof dish, and burning it with a candle (explicitly avoiding matches, due to a Hoodoo taboo regarding sulphur). Instructions for disposing of ashes and perishable offerings are also provided."

      "chapter_title": "The Novena of Expedite",
      "summary": "The book concludes with a nine-day novena dedicated to Saint Expedite. This involves daily lighting of a red candle and reciting a specific sequence of prayers, including the Our Father, Hail Mary, and the particular novena prayers for each day. The practitioner is instructed to mention their desired grace and promise to follow Saint Expedite's example and propagate his devotion. On the final day, any remaining candle is allowed to burn out, and fresh flowers are offered. The novena is presented as a powerful devotional act for receiving benefits."
