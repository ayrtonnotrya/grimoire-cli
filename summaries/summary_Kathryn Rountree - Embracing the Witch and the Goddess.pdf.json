It emphasizes personal autonomy, internal spiritual power ('power-from-within'), and a holistic worldview that sees all nature and life as sacred and interconnected. Magic is understood instrumentally as a means to effect desired change, both personal and societal, through concentrated intent, symbolic action, and alignment with universal energy, rather than through external deities or dogmatic adherence.",

I have quite a functionalist view of it. It’s great to feel that there are supernatural things, and I think it’s fine to invent them. Because when you’re actually doing the rituals, you do believe in it. The fact that you know you’re creating it doesn’t take away from the sacredness of it or stop you fiercely believing in something. It’s never been a contradiction to me, and I don’t think a lot of women have a problem with it either.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant for scholars and practitioners of Western Esotericism and Occultism as it provides a rare and detailed ethnographic account of modern magical practices in a specific regional context (New Zealand). It uniquely positions feminist witchcraft not just as a social movement but as an operative magical system, explaining *how* practitioners understand and enact magic. Rountree's work challenges traditional academic skepticism by validating the subjective experiences of witches, offering insights into their holistic worldview, ritual structures, and theories of change through 'energy work.' It is particularly valuable for understanding the intersection of feminist politics with magical practice and the complex issue of cultural appropriation in eclectic spiritual traditions.",
    "target_audience": "Academic researchers and students in religious studies, anthropology, sociology, and gender studies with an interest in contemporary new religious movements, Western esotericism, and feminist theory. Practitioners of modern Paganism, Wicca, and Goddess spirituality will find it a valuable resource for understanding the philosophical underpinnings, practical mechanics, and community dynamics of feminist magical traditions, especially those in the Southern Hemisphere."
