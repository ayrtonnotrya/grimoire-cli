    "description": "The A.'.A.'. system, as detailed in Liber CLXXXV, constitutes a highly organized, hierarchical initiatory path from Probationer (0=0) to Adeptus Minor (5=6). Each of the seven grades is characterized by a set of prescribed tasks, required readings (primarily Aleister Crowley's 'Holy Books' or 'Libers'), practical magical exercises, and a formal oath. Progression is linear and merit-based, with each grade requiring the completion of specific objectives, the attainment of certain states of consciousness, and the demonstration of mastery over defined skills, overseen by a mentor from a higher grade. The system emphasizes self-discipline, unwavering dedication, and a 'scientific' approach to validating spiritual experiences. The ultimate practical objective is the systematic dismantling of the ego and the cultivation of awareness leading to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.",
