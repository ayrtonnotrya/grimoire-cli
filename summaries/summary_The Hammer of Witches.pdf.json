This genre of literature is exemplified in the Greek poet Semonides’ attack on women or the Sixth Satire of the Roman poet Juvenal. By this standard, the Malleus is not misogynistic in that even the main passage discussing what is taken to be the flawed nature of females is prefaced with an overt statement that the negative characterization of women as a group does not apply to all of them (42B), and the work contains references to pious women who resist the allurements of sorcery or fall victim to it.",
