      "summary": "This lesson introduces the esoteric significance of Tarot Key 13, the Hebrew letter Nun (meaning fish and to propagate), and its connection to the Great Deep/Mother Sea. It recounts a personal meditative experience of a child who, after prayer and self-inquiry, experienced a profound sense of unity and bliss, floating in an infinite ocean of love, peace, and bliss. This experience is linked to developing supersensory awareness and understanding the nature of consciousness. The lesson also delves into the symbolism of Tarot Key 13, emphasizing change, reaping wisdom and understanding from past experiences (karma), and the role of the subconscious (moon) in this process. It highlights the concept of purified desire, the electromagnetic interchange in union, and the idea of death as a rebirth, crucial for spiritual evolution. The practical technique for Key 13 involves visualizing the Tarot imagery to embrace change and purification."

It draws upon Qabalistic concepts and internal experiential accounts to offer a path toward spiritual evolution and enhanced consciousness. The emphasis on purified desire and unity connects it to Hermetic and mystical traditions, while the focus on imagination and inner experience aligns with modern magical thought.",
