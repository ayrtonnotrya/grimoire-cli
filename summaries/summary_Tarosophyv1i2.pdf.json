Miss Pamela Coleman Smith, in addition to her obvious gifts, has some knowledge of Tarot values; she has lent a sympathetic ear to my proposal to rectify the symbolism by reference to channels of knowledge which are not in the open day; and we have had other help from one who is deeply versed in the subject.",

Marcus Katz's research on the Celtic Cross is a standout, providing crucial historical evidence that challenges widely held beliefs about its origins and naming, effectively placing it within the Golden Dawn tradition rather than a spurious 'ancient Celtic' one. This archival work is invaluable for academic occult studies. The magazine also integrates practical applications, such as Keren Happuch's astrological correlations and the ethical guidelines for practitioners, directly addressing the professionalization and responsible practice of Tarot in the modern world. The inclusion of artistic and cultural analyses of Tarot decks (Deviant Moon, Japanese Tarot) broadens the field beyond just divination, emphasizing Tarot as a rich cultural artifact and esoteric tool.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience is broad within the esoteric community, encompassing both novice and advanced Tarot readers, students of Western Esotericism (especially Golden Dawn traditions), professional Tarot practitioners, and those interested in occult history, astrology, and the artistic/cultural dimensions of Tarot. The detailed historical research appeals to academics, while practical exercises and ethical guidelines cater to practitioners seeking to refine their skills and operate responsibly. The diverse content, from musicology to new deck concepts, ensures relevance for a wide spectrum of occult enthusiasts."
