It operates on the principle that individuals possess an innate 'Magic Power' (a subtle energy) that can be harnessed and directed through focused intent, visualization, and ritualistic actions. The system emphasizes: 1. Defining Clear Desires: Practitioners must clearly articulate what they want to manifest. 2. Energy Cultivation: Techniques like the 'Star Position' and 'Inhale Cosmic Energy' are used to raise and accumulate personal power. 3. Visualization & Affirmation: Mental images of the desired outcome, combined with positive verbal affirmations, are crucial for directing energy. 4. Ritual & Spell Casting: Specific, often simple, rituals involving common household items (candles, salt, thread) are used to 'charge' the intention and send it into the 'cosmic space.' 5. Ethical Application: A strict emphasis on 'White Witchcraft' means all practices must be for beneficial, non-harmful outcomes. The system is presented as a practical self-help guide, empowering individuals to take control of their lives and manifest their realities through conscious manipulation of energetic forces.",
