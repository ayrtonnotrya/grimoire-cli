The aim is to cultivate a higher consciousness (supraconsciencia) by integrating intellectual, emotional, and physical aspects, leading to practical magical power and spiritual illumination. The author stresses a 'from-above-down' approach, starting with Kether (Spirit) and manifesting through the lower Sephiroth (Form), ensuring operations align with cosmic laws and avoid negative repercussions.",
