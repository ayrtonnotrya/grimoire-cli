  "central_thesis": "This book reconstructs and presents an authentic Graeco-Egyptian Magick self-initiatory system for modern practitioners. The core aim is to guide individuals through a systematic process of spiritual development and empowerment by sequentially working with the energies of the seven planetary spheres (Moon to Saturn). This process leads to self-knowledge, harmonisation with cosmic energies, access to the divine spark, and ultimately, integration of spirituality into everyday life, fostering wholeness and completeness.",

The goal is to integrate these energies into daily life, foster self-knowledge, overcome duality, and access the 'divine spark' for sustained spiritual development and empowerment. The process emphasizes working 'IN SEQUENCE' and 'not to be rushed' to avoid unpleasant experiences.",
