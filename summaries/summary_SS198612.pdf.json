A Magus 'utters' a 'Word of the Æon,' a central magical concept that defines and guides Setian development for an era. James Lewis is the new Magus V°."

      "definition": "The new Word of the Æon introduced by Magus James Lewis V°. It addresses man's intrinsic 'questing nature' and the desire to avoid 'personal annihilation' beyond the biological body, indicating a continued existence. Magically, it represents the imperative for power absorbed from 'Black Magic' experiences to 'do something and go somewhere,' manifesting outwardly from the self into its environs. It is presented as a 'logical, progressive step' beyond 'Xeper'."

      "term": "Xeper",

      "definition": "A constructed language (by Dr. John W. Weilgart) proposed as a 'Martian' tongue.

For Setians, it offers benefits like enhanced confidentiality, clarity of communication, perceptual restructuring ('reconstruction of your experience of reality'), potential telepathy, and a means to achieve 'Xeper via Whorfian Hypothesis' leading to an 'identity shift of superhuman proportions'."

      "term": "Black Magic (Setian Context)",

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system outlined or implied in this document centers on the individual Initiate's pursuit of self-creation and continued existence, driven by the 'Word of the Æon.' This involves deeply understanding and applying 'Remanifestation' as a process of outward manifestation of internally absorbed power from 'Black Magic' experiences. The system is highly intellectual and philosophical, requiring continuous self-definition and the rejection of external dogma. It emphasizes the active development of the 'active self' to influence one's environs and prepare for a future beyond the biological body. Integral to this is the potential restructuring of perception and communication through specialized tools like the 'aUI' language.",

It details a significant event—the recognition of a new Magus and the introduction of a new 'Word of the Æon'—which represents a philosophical and practical advancement beyond previous Setian tenets. The articles provide primary source material on the evolution of Setian magical philosophy, particularly the interplay between 'Xeper' and 'Remanifestation,' and explore practical magical applications like the 'aUI' language and the philosophical implications of individual perception and Black Magic. It also offers insights into the community's cultural engagements through film analysis and personal reflections on conclaves, grounding the esoteric theory in lived experience.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of Initiates of the Temple of Set, particularly those at higher degrees (III° and above) who are engaged in advanced magical work and the philosophical tenets of Setianism. The detailed expositions of 'Remanifestation' and 'aUI' are aimed at practitioners seeking to deepen their understanding and application of Setian principles. Additionally, scholars and serious researchers of modern Western Esotericism, particularly those specializing in the Temple of Set or contemporary magical currents, would find this document invaluable for its historical and doctrinal insights."
