    "description": "The system described in Shams al-Ma'arif al-Kubra is a comprehensive operative magical framework. It centers on the 99 Divine Names (Asma al-Husna), each imbued with unique numerical values (abjad) and letter correspondences. Practitioners undergo rigorous spiritual retreats (riyada) involving seclusion, fasting, and intense, repetitive recitations (dhikr) of specific divine names or Qur'anic verses, often thousands of times. This purification process aims to attune the practitioner to divine energies. The core operative technique involves creating 'wafaqat' (magical grids or talismans) by inscribing specific divine names, their numerical values, and associated letters on various materials (e.g., paper, metals, animal skin). These inscriptions must be performed at astrologically auspicious times (planetary hours, lunar phases) to harness specific celestial influences. These talismans are then activated and used for a wide array of intentions, including attracting love, wealth, protection, healing, influencing authorities, or performing spirit evocation. The rituals often combine talismanic work with specific prayers (du'a) and sometimes fumigation (bakhur).",

    "relevance": "Shams al-Ma'arif al-Kubra is a foundational and highly influential text in Islamic occultism and grimoire traditions, with enduring relevance across the Middle East, North Africa, and extending to Western esotericism through various Hermetic and Qabalistic influences. It details a comprehensive system of operative magic rooted in divine names, Qur'anic verses, and Arabic letter mysticism. The work provides a practical framework for practitioners seeking spiritual advancement, worldly success, protection, healing, and influence over others. Historically, it serves as a primary source for understanding medieval magical practices and their philosophical underpinnings in the Islamic world, predating or paralleling many European grimoires.",

The text explicitly warns against revealing certain 'secrets' to the uninitiated, indicating its intended use by those already on a mystical or magical path."
