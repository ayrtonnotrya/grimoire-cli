  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system in 'Spells' is an eclectic blend of folk magic, sympathetic/empathic principles, aromatherapy, and visualization, anchored in personal will and positive intent. Rituals involve the manipulation of symbolic objects (herbs, oils, candles, crystals, personal items) carefully chosen for their energetic correspondences, often guided by astrological timing (planetary days). The core operative mechanics rely on: 1) Intentional Visualization, serving as the 'fuel' to direct magical energy; 2) Intuition, developed through meditation, to guide spell construction and application; and 3) Affirmation/Incantation, to verbally charge and declare the spell's purpose. The system strictly adheres to an ethical framework, advocating only for positive magic and emphasizing that 'negativity can only beget negativity.'",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "'Spells' by Matthew Green is highly relevant within contemporary occultism for its accessible and positive approach to practical magic. It positions spellcraft as a tool for personal empowerment and self-improvement, diverging from more complex ceremonial or grimoire traditions by emphasizing readily available materials and intuitive practice. This demystification of magic, coupled with its ethical stance against 'dark magic,' makes it a foundational text for those new to the field, fostering a sense of agency and connection to spiritual forces for everyday desires. Its eclectic blend of folk traditions from the Caribbean, American South, Europe, Native American cultures, and Brazil provides a broad, culturally inclusive perspective on practical magic.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience for 'Spells' is the beginner or novice practitioner interested in practical magic, folk traditions, and self-help through ritual. This includes individuals seeking non-dogmatic spiritual paths, those looking for accessible ways to address personal challenges (love, money, protection, career), and parents interested in magical methods for their children's well-being. The book's emphasis on harmlessness, ease of ingredient acquisition, and the power of personal visualization also appeals to a broader audience curious about magic but wary of complex or negative practices."
