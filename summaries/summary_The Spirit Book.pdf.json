      "text": "Mediumship is an aspect of spirit communication that can be fraudulently duplicated with ease. In fact the history of Spiritualism is replete with imposters—those who preyed upon the bereaved. But just because mediumship can be done fraudulently does not mean that all mediums are frauds. Far from it. The history is also filled with wonderful examples of the most amazing people who have demonstrated time and again, in front of the most intense investigations, that contact with the spirits of the deceased is not only possible but is certain.",
      "page": "16"
    },
    {
      "text": "Channeling differs from mediumship in that where a medium is allowing the living to communicate with their deceased loved ones on a very personal level, the channeler is acting as a pipeline for an entity that offers teachings in the form of lectures. These might be on an individual basis but are more often presented in a large auditorium, with no exchange with the audience other than, perhaps, a short question and answer period at the end.",

      "text": "The medium’s mind is taken over to a greater or lesser degree by the controlling spirit. In my own case this was a gradual process of complete withdrawal on my part and an increasing command on Chan’s [her spirit guide]. Its purpose in psychic and spiritual terms is to extend the power of spiritual influence to reach and obtain more positive response in communication with the other world.",
