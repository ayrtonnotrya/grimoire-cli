      "summary": "This article outlines the initiatory progression of a Setian's magical practice, focusing on the evolution of a 'neter' (magical name) into a 'telesmic' (an independent energetic form). It describes stages of development: 'Imagination' for choosing a neter, 'Imagery' for refining it into a telesmic through focused will, 'Indulgence' where the II° initiate performs magic with the telesmic, and 'Xeper' as the merging and understanding of the neter's true nature, leading to integrated 'Becoming' and deeper interaction with Set. The telesmic functions as the magician's 'mouth' to Set and 'heart'."

The system emphasizes rigorous self-discipline, focused imagination, and a deep understanding of esoteric principles (e.g., Golden Section) to construct physical tools like altars. It also integrates a reinterpretation of traditional annual holidays into a framework for consistent magical work, introspection, and goal-setting aligned with the principle of Xeper.",
