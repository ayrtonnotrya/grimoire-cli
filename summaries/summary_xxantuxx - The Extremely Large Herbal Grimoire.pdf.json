It provides specific instructions for how to utilize a vast array of natural herbs for particular magical ends, emphasizing direct, hands-on application. The magic operates primarily on principles of sympathetic resonance and energetic projection, where the 'magickal uses' inherent in an herb (e.g., 'protection,' 'love,' 'money') are activated and directed towards a desired outcome through specific physical actions, preparations, and often mental intent or visualization. The grimoire functions as a practical manual for spell execution rather than a theoretical treatise.",
