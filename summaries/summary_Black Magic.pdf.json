It delineates Lesser Black Magic (LBM) for influencing the Objective Universe (OU) through psychological and social manipulation, and Greater Black Magic (GBM) for causing direct change in the Subjective Universe (SU) which may harmoniously affect the OU. Medial Black Magic (MBM) serves as a bridge, employing the Magical Link for direct, simple influence on the OU. The system emphasizes rigorous study, ethical responsibility, and disciplined practice, rather than blind faith.",

      "Medial Black Magic (MBM): Less formal, direct application of the Magical Link for specific goals, such as influencing situations in the OU through will and simple acts like lighting a candle or gazing at the moon. It emphasizes coherent will and understanding over elaborate ceremony."
