It progresses through each of the Four Elements (Air, Fire, Water, Earth) individually, covering their correspondences, characteristics, and methods for balancing and manipulation. Key practices include energetic exercises, specific elemental techniques (like 'boxes' and 'message boxes'), and applications in self-healing and healing others. Each class is framed with an 'Exit Ritual' to mark the completion of a session, indicating a disciplined approach to magical work. The culmination is an understanding of how the elements interact to adjust overall energy balances.",
