  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system detailed in 'Herbal Magick' is a syncretic approach to plant-based spellcraft, integrating elements from Pagan, Wiccan, Hoodoo, and Gypsy folk traditions. It is founded on the principle that herbs possess inherent 'magickal energies' (page 11) that can be directed and amplified through specific rituals, charms, and divinatory methods. The efficacy of these workings is often contingent upon precise timing, aligning with lunar phases (new, waxing, full, waning moon), planetary hours, and specific days of the week (e.g., Friday for Venus-ruled love spells, Sunday for Sun-ruled protection). The system explicitly incorporates both 'white' (healing, protection, attraction) and 'gray' (self-defense hexes) magical applications, with the author advocating for personalizing spells and cultivating intuitive engagement to enhance results (page 10).",
