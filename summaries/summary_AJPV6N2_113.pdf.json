To proactively circumvent further delays due to Australia's extended Christmas-New Year's shutdown (late December through January), the December 2006 issue was prepared and dispatched earlier than usual. The editor, on behalf of the Australian Institute of Parapsychological Research (AIPR), expresses appreciation for reader support despite past issues and extends season's greetings."
