  "central_thesis": "Sacred wells and waters are universally recognized as powerful loci throughout human history, embodying feminine divine power, healing, wisdom, and connections to the Otherworld. Despite Christianization and societal shifts, ancient pagan traditions, rituals, and beliefs associated with these sites persist, reflecting a continuous human engagement with the 'spirit of place' and deep-seated archetypal memory. The perceived efficacy of these sites stems from both their subtle energetic properties (e.g., natural radioactivity, mineral content) and the conscious spiritual connection fostered through ritual interaction.",

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book synthesizes a practical system of engaging with sacred wells and waters as powerful spiritual loci, drawing from ancient pagan, folk, and Christianized magical traditions.

Efficacy is attributed to both subtle energetic forces (e.g., 'subtle vibratory force,' 'natural radioactivity,' 'magnetic currents') and the profound psychological/spiritual state induced in the practitioner.",

It is suggested variously that the custom may represent the idea that the disease will be left in the discarded rag; or it may be that it is a relic of the habit of leaving the whole of the garment as an offering. It may equally be a sign of penance, or a sign of thanksgiving — a forerunner perhaps of the crutches and other indications of debility cured by faith which one sees today….”",

It would also appeal to individuals exploring personal spirituality, geomancy, and deep connections to the 'spirit of place' through ritual engagement."
