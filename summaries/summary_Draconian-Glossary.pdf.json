      "definition": "In the Qabalah, the Abyss is the dark side of the hidden Sephira Daath. It is the gulf that exists in between the Tree of Qliphoth and the Tree of Sephiroth – bridging the world of manifestation with the non-manifest. It is ruled by Beast 666 in its double aspect: Choronzon (The Demon of Dispersion) and Shugal (The Howler in the Desert)."

    {
      "term": "Apsū",
      "definition": "Personification of fresh waters in the Babylonian Creation epic, the Enûma Eliš. Lover and spouse to another primal deity, the dragon goddess Tiamat, personification of salty waters. In Sumerian and Akkadian mythology, Apsū is the primeval sea existing below the earth, the void space, and the source of all life."

    {
      "term": "Adversary",
      "definition": "The title attributed to a number of mythological characters who play the role of the “enemy” or “opponent” to the supreme deity. The concept is connected to Satan, whose “name” comes from Hebrew and translates to “accuser” or “adversary,” showing him as the primary force standing in opposition to God. In various sources the “adversaries” include Lucifer, Lilith, Belial, Beelzebub, and many other literary and mythological figures."
    },
    {
      "term": "Antinomian",
      "definition": "The term “antinomianism” is derived from the Greek words ἀντί (anti - “against”) and νόμος (nomos - \"law”), and it originally referred to views opposing Christianity and obligation to follow the law of faith. It was first used in the 16th century, while the concept of spiritual liberation through rejection of the moral, social and religious norms was already used in early Gnostic sects in the first centuries AD. Sometimes this is erroneously interpreted as performing illegal actions to break the law. In fact, antinomianism is a practice aimed at spiritual transcendence, assuming that liberation and salvation can only be attained if we free ourselves from the limitations of man-made laws and values."
    },
    {
      "term": "Apep",
      "definition": "In ancient Egypt, Apep was the demon of darkness and chaos, enemy of light and the order of Ma'at. He was regarded as the greatest and the most dangerous opponent of Ra, personifying chaos, darkness and disorder. His depictions presented him as a serpent, crocodile, or dragon.

      "term": "Arachne",
      "definition": "In ancient Greek mythology, Arachne was a mortal woman, who angered the goddess Athena by challenging her to a weaving contest and was cursed by the goddess to weave for all time. Since that moment her name has become ascribed to spiders (Arachnida), and all spider-like creatures are believed to be her children. In the Draconian/Typhonian tradition, Arachne is the name of the Spider Goddess of the Qliphoth, the Queen of Space and the Weaver of the Web in the Void. The Web of Arachne extends across the Void, having an intricate symmetry that links all existing planes and dimensions with infinitely tenuous threads of light, manifesting to a Nightside traveler as a network of tunnels and vortices. It bridges the gulf between the Dayside and the Nightside, waking and dreaming, the conscious and the unconscious."
    },
    {
      "term": "Ascending Flame",
      "definition": "The concept representing the fully risen and sublimated energy of the Fire Snake/Serpent Force/Kundalini. In the Temple of Ascending Flame, it is symbolic of golden energy that is formed from the awakened and united forces of Ida and Pingala, the divine feminine and the divine masculine, flowing through the central channel (nadi). In Tantra, these two forces are represented by Shakti and Shiva. In the Temple of Ascending Flame, they are Lilith and Lucifer. Their combined currents ignite the spark of divinity, which successively, with each lesser and greater initiation, becomes \"the Ascending Flame\" and the pillar of ascent on the path of self-deification."

He is also one of the demons that worked on the construction of the Temple of Solomon. His name is derived from Avestan language and he is associated with the Middle-Eastern demon of wrath called Aēšma-Daēva. Other variations of his name include Ashmedai, Asmodai, Asmodee, Hasmedai, Shamdon, and Sinodai. Asmodeus appears in many sources and is a recognizable character of demonology and old magical grimoires. In the Dictionnaire Infernal by Collin de Plancy, he is depicted with the breast of a man, a cock's leg, a serpent's tail, three heads, riding a lion with dragon's wings and neck. He is also a part of Goetia, where he is described as a powerful king. He has three heads: the first of a bull, the second of a man, and the third of a ram, the tail of a serpent, and feet webbed like those of a goose. From his mouth issue flames of fire and he sits upon an infernal dragon, bearing a lance with a banner in his hand. He teaches the arts of arithmetic, astronomy, geometry, and all handicrafts. He also makes the magician invincible, bestows the Ring of Virtues and reveals hidden treasures."

      "term": "Behemoth",
      "definition": "A beast described in the biblical Book of Job as a primordial monster created by God at the beginning of Creation. He is often mentioned together with Leviathan, the Serpent of Chaos. While Leviathan is believed to be female and represents the element of water, Behemoth (plural of “behamah” = “beast\") is male and connected with the element of earth. In Jewish lore, they were created on the fifth day and separated because the waters could not hold them together. And so Behemoth went to dwell in the mountains and in the deserts, while for Leviathan God assigned the seventh part of the earth – the one filled with waters. Behemoth became the lord of the dry land, Leviathan – the ruler of waters and all watery creatures."

    {
      "term": "Belial",
      "definition": "As an evil spirit, Belial appears in a number of sources, from the Bible and Jewish apocryphal literature to modern Satanism and the writings of Anton LaVey. He is also mentioned in such texts as the Dead Sea Scrolls, where he appears as the Angel of Darkness and the antagonist of God. In old sources, his name is used as a synonym for Satan, and he is one of the most commonly recognized personifications of evil. It is even thought that the name \"Belial\" (or Beliar) does not refer to any specific spirit, but it is simply a title signifying wickedness. Other meanings of the name include, “destruction,” “ruin,” “death,” “the abyss,\" \"lawlessness,” or “without a master.\" The most common interpretation is derived from the Talmud and explains the name “Belial” as composed of two words: “beli” and “ol,” or “yo'il,” which means \"without a yoke” or “without advantage,” i.e., “worthless.” In Goetia, Belial is listed among 72 spirits in the rank of a king. He appears in the form of two beautiful angels sitting in a chariot of fire, speaks with a comely voice, and his powers include distributing offices and titles and causing the favor of friends and foes. In the Bible and the apocrypha, \"Belial” is a synonym for the prince of darkness, the Antichrist, the Devil, the father of idolatry, the demon of impurity, the angel of lawlessness, and the ruler of the world, identified with Samael."

      "term": "Caduceus",
      "definition": "A staff with two snakes entwined around it, with wings on top of them. The caduceus is an ancient symbol, associated with Mercury, the messenger of gods in Roman mythology. In the Draconian Tradition, it represents the ascent of the Kundalini serpent, where the snakes are symbolic of Ida and Pingala (the left and the right nadi) and the staff stands for the central channel, Shushumna. The wings represent the Kundalini force raised and sublimated into a higher principle."
    },
    {
      "term": "Cave of Lilith",
      "definition": "In Qabalah, the Cave of Lilith is the lowest of the Qliphoth, the equivalent of Malkuth. In the Temple of Ascending Flame, this is the point of entrance to the entire Dark Tree – the starting place for any travels into the Qliphoth. It is the vulva of the Dark Mother and the threshold between the Dayside and the Nightside. In Jewish folklore, the Cave of Lilith is the dwelling place of the goddess after she left the Garden of Eden and settled on the shore of the Red Sea."
    },
    {
      "term": "Centering",
      "definition": "A practice that places the magician in the center of the ritual space, allowing to maintain balance during the working. It also focuses the practitioner's personal energy in the inner \"center,\" which can be one of the chakras, e.g., the solar plexus, the heart, or another point within the subtle body that functions as a point of balance and inner power."
    },
    {
      "term": "Cerberus",
      "definition": "In Greek mythology, Cerberus is the guardian of the gate to the underworld. He is called the “hound of Hades” and usually depicted as a monstrous dog with three heads, a serpent for a tail, and multiple snakes protruding from parts of his body. His function is to prevent the dead from leaving as well as to ensure that no mortals will attempt to pass through the gate. In Draconian magic, Cerberus is viewed as one of primal Draconian entities that can be worked with to gain access to the reservoir of the Serpent Force, the vehicle of the whole Draconian/Ophidian current."
    },
    {
      "term": "Chakras",
      "definition": "The chakras are inner energy vortices, which activated by the Serpent Force stimulate and expand psychic faculties. In Sanskrit, the word “chakra” means “disk” or “wheel.” In the ritual system of the Temple of Ascending Flame, there are seven main chakras to work with, but this paradigm differs depending on the spiritual tradition. Each chakra is believed to be connected with particular parts of the body, emotions and spiritual concepts. If the chakra is balanced, its influence manifests as a state of well-being. A malfunctioning chakra can be responsible for diseases, emotional imbalance and mental disorders. The seven main chakras in the Draconian Tradition are: Muldhara (root), Svadisthana (sexual center), Manipura (solar plexus), Anahata (heart), Vishuddi (throat), Ajna (brow/forehead), and Sahasrara (crown)."

    },
    {
      "term": "Daimon",
      "definition": "The concept derived from Greek daimôn, meaning “godlike power,\" \"fate,” or “god.” The daimôn was a messenger of the gods and an intermediary between the divine and mortal realms. The contemporary magic included a number of methods and techniques to absorb and unite with the personal daimôn, because through this unity a magician could become “a son of a god” and exert one's Will over the whole universe. In Draconian magic, a “daimon” or “daemon” is a concept denoting the higher essence, or “Higher Self,\" of an individual."
    },
    {
      "term": "Demon",
      "definition": "Today, a term usually attributed to an evil or malevolent spirit. The word itself, however, is derived from the Greek daimôn, which was a kind of a demigod or quasi-divinity that could be attached to an individual by means of magical techniques. A daimôn could be either good and helpful (the agathodaimôn) or vicious and evil (the kakodaimôn)."
    },
    {
      "term": "Dark Feminine",
      "definition": "The force also referred to as the Dark Goddess or Dark Mother. In the Qabalah, the Dark Feminine is connected with Sitra Ahra and the entire Nightside, although this current is specifically focused in, or flowing from, Satariel (Binah) on the Tree of Qliphoth. It is the shadow side of the Divine Feminine, the female force permeating the whole universe – the devouring principle of all destruction and all creation. The example is Tiamat from the Babylonian Creation epic Enūma Eliš, who creates all gods in the universe as well as all monsters and creatures of chaos, giving birth to both light and darkness. It is the primeval womb from which all forms of consciousness emerge and which can devour them at any time, thus reabsorbing them into the primordial waters of non-being. This force is limitless and amorphous, although it can be worked with through female deities such as, for example, Lilith."
    },
    {
      "term": "Dragon",
      "definition": "The infinite and timeless current of energy that permeates the earth and human consciousness and may be accessed and used as an evolutionary vehicle by a practitioner working with the “Dragon Force,” i.e., Kundalini. The Dragon exists internally and externally – as the Inner Dragon and the Outer Dragon. The Inner Dragon is the internal force that brings forth illumination and liberation from limitations of the human nature. The Outer Dragon is the force contained in nature, responsible for such phenomena as thunderstorms, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcano eruptions, etc. Draconian magic works to access and transform this force, both inner and outer, into a vehicle of spiritual evolution."
    },
    {
      "term": "Dragon Lines",
      "definition": "Also known as “ley lines” – mystical veins of energy connecting power spots on the earth. It is believed that they are aligned with various buildings and landmarks, such as ancient temples and cult places, connecting them with a stream of force constituting the network of energy encompassing the entire globe. This is an analogy to the energy flow within the human body, which occurs through channels (nadis) and chakras. According to this belief, the earth also has channels and chakras, which function as energy vortices for the entire planet. In the Babylonian myth of creation, the body of the slain dragon goddess Tiamat is used to create Earth. Therefore, the \"Dragon Lines\" can be associated with the mystical veins of the primordial dragon, focusing the flow of the Dragon Force through the channels and chakras of the planet."
    },
    {
      "term": "Evocation",
      "definition": "The practice of summoning spirits into a vessel of manifestation and interacting with them externally. In this method, communication occurs through a medium, while the summoner asks questions or commands a spirit to perform a specific task. The \"medium” can be a person acting as the magician's assistant, having the ability to gaze into the spirit realm and convey the messages to the summoner. It can also be an inanimate object, such as a crystal, special vessel, or magic mirror, which serves as a gateway to the Other Side. The spirit is \"evoked,” i.e., summoned into the vessel of manifestation, and sent back through the same gateway after the ritual is finished."
    },
    {
      "term": "Eye of Lucifer",
      "definition": "The center of awareness and illumination, allowing for access to higher planes and forms of consciousness. In Luciferian magic, this concept refers to the Third Eye and the activation of the higher senses (the upper chakras). In Qliphothic Qabalah, the Eye of Lucifer is a concept connected with Satariel and the mysteries of Lucifuge Rofocale, the Evening Star. In the Draconian Tradition, it is also associated with the Star Chakra (Sunya/Sunyata), which is the Dark Eye that pierces all veils and illusions and the Eye of the Dragon that exists in the Void."

    {
      "term": "Gate of Sunset",
      "definition": "The concept denoting the gate to the Current of the Dragon. It refers to the sun setting in the West, which was believed to be the gate to the underworld, the land of the dead, and the nether regions in general. The disappearance of the sun behind the horizon marks the transition between the day and night and heralds the victory of darkness over light and the time when the forces from the Other Side enter the physical plane. In Draconian magic, the altar in rituals is usually placed in the West."
    },
    {
      "term": "Gnosticism",
      "definition": "The name attributed to religious and philosophical movement that flourished among Jewish and early Christian sects in the first and second centuries CE. Derived from the Greek gnosis, meaning \"knowledge” or “insight,” it involved a variety of teachings and beliefs based on the idea that the world of man was created by a malevolent divinity (Demiurge), while humanity are souls imprisoned in mortal bodies. In consequence, the material world is flawed and evil, and the physical existence is a constant struggle for liberation and return to the divine source."
    },
    {
      "term": "Goetia",
      "definition": "Part of The Lesser Key of Solomon, also known as Lemegeton. The five books of the grimoire are the Ars Goetia, Ars Theurgia-Goetia, Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel, and Ars Notoria. It was compiled in the 17th century from older materials, such as Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum and a 15th-century manuscript titled Livre des Esperitz. Goetia is both the title of the text and a magical system based on working with the 72 spirits described in it. The list of spirits contains their descriptions, seals, titles, ranks in the infernal hierarchy, and the number of inferior entities given in legions."

      "term": "Grimoire",
      "definition": "A grimoire is a textbook or book of spells for a magician, containing formulas, seals and instructions on how to summon spirits, create talismans and amulets, perform divination, or cause a change in the physical world."

    },
    {
      "term": "Hecate",
      "definition": "Known from ancient Greek mythology, Hecate is the patroness of the crossroads, liminality, night, entrance-ways and gates, magic, witchcraft, the moon and lunar mysteries, herbs and poisonous plants, necromancy, and sorcery. Often depicted with a torch or pair of torches, a key, snakes and owls, also accompanied by dogs. Her common depiction is a woman with three heads or three women standing together. Although referred to as “goddess,” Hecate, in fact, belongs to Titans, and her parents are believed to be Perses and Asteria. She is associated with many aspects and many powers. Her ancient cults referred to the concept of life and death. She was benevolent and generous to nature and to humans, as well as ruthless and responsible for all nocturnal atrocities and destructive witchcraft. She ruled the earth, the sky and the sea, and she also decided about human fates. Her worshippers prayed to her for happiness, wealth and prosperity. She could endow man with wealth, power and fame, protected soldiers in battles and sailors at sea. She watched over the justice in courts and granted victory in competitions, and she was also worshipped as the patroness of agriculture. In the Draconian Tradition, Hecate is the teacher of witchcraft, the guide to our personal \"underworld\" (symbol for the unconscious), and the guardian of the mystical Crossroads."
    },

      "term": "Higher Self",
      "definition": "The concept referring to divine consciousness, which is intelligent, omnipotent and transcending the flaws and limitations of the human nature, yet is at the same time part of each human being. It is the extension of the worldly Self to a godlike state."

      "term": "Individuation",
      "definition": "In Jungian psychology, individuation is the process of successive development of the Self as an indivisible unity, unique and distinct from other individuals and collective consciousness.

    },
    {
      "term": "Invocation",
      "definition": "Summoning the consciousness of a spirit or god-form to be experienced internally. In rites of invocation, the mundane consciousness and the human senses of a practitioner are overridden by the summoned force, and what remains is the consciousness of the deity whose knowledge and powers are sought. This connection occurs on the subconscious level and is translated by the mind of the magician to conscious messages, insights, observations, etc., which can be utilized for the purpose of growth, initiation and self-awareness. It is a form of “possession,” in which the individual retains a certain degree of normal awareness in order to learn about the nature and powers of the summoned entity and is able to control this force through Willpower."
    },
    {
      "term": "Jormungandr",
      "definition": "In Norse mythology, Jörmungandr is a huge serpent dwelling in the world sea, encircling the earth and biting his own tail, like Ouroboros.

    },
    {
      "term": "Kundalini",
      "definition": "Divine energy located at the base of the spine. The name is derived from Sanskrit, and means “coiled snake,” which is the reason why it is also called the Serpent Force, Dragon Force, or Fire Snake. It is the primal reservoir of energy that is worked with in Draconian magic. Kundalini is believed to be feminine (Shakti) and associated with such deities in the Hindu religion as Parvati or Bhairavi, as well as with Lilith in the ritual system of the Temple of Ascending Flame. Awakened and activated, Kundalini energy rises through the channels (nadis) in the subtle system of the practitioner, cleansing and refining the chakras and leading to spiritual illumination and transcendence. It can be awakened by meditation, breathing techniques, the practice of asana, and the chanting of mantras. In the Draconian Tradition, it is the primary vehicle of evolution, spiritual liberation and expansion of consciousness."
    },
    {
      "term": "Left Hand Path & Right Hand Path",
      "definition": "Both terms are derived from Hindu Tantrism, where vamachara or vamamarga (“left hand path”) is a definition of a magical path based on breaking taboos and acting against conventions and set morality, while dakshinachara (“right hand path\") follows ethics and social rules. In Western esotericism, the term “Left Hand Path\" refers to a specific approach to magic, in which the emphasis is placed on individual practice, isolation of consciousness from a \"supreme deity,” and spiritual and mental deprogramming. While the goal of the Right Hand Path is union with God or another outer force, viewed as supreme and existing separately, the Left Hand Path strives for \"self-deification” and working with the inner potential to develop god-like consciousness independent of outer sources."
    },
    {
      "term": "Leviathan",
      "definition": "The Serpent of Chaos. In Hebrew, “Leviathan” means “that which gathers itself into folds” or “that which is drawn out,\" referring to a mythical serpent, dragon, crocodile, whale, or another sea beast. In Gnostic texts, Leviathan is the Anima Mundi, the soul of the world, the eternal beginning and end, the element of chaos within. The Old Testament depicts Leviathan as a female sea serpent. Her body is 300 miles long, and when she is hungry, the heat from her mouth causes all waters to boil. In the Draconian Tradition, Leviathan is the intermediary between Lilith and Samael/Lucifer, corresponding to the Qabalistic serpent Tanin'iver. It is both the Inner and the Outer Dragon - the primal force of creation and destruction and the inner evolutionary potential of man. In the macrocosmic sense, Leviathan is the very beginning, the original cosmic force that gave rise to the universe. On the microcosmic level, s/he represents the inner source of continuous transformation and timeless existence, the principle that activates and binds all processes of the Self."
    },
    {
      "term": "Lilith",
      "definition": "The Queen of Sitra Ahra (The Other Side). Possibly, she originated in Mesopotamian mythology, but became known through Jewish folklore and Qabalistic literature. Her role is described extensively in multiple books, and her role is explored in detail in Rites of Lilith: Grimoire of the Queen of the Night. In Jewish legends, she is the first wife of Adam, banished from the Garden of Eden for not obeying her husband. She is mentioned in the Book of Isaiah, Jewish mythology, Mandean texts, and many other sources, including the Gnostic grimoire Liber Lilith. In the Temple of Ascending Flame, she is the primary initiatrix into the mysteries of the Tree of Qliphoth. She seduces the Initiates and guides them through the path of Qliphothic alchemy and mysteries of eroto-mysticism in order to help them release the Fire Snake. Like the Kundalini force that awakens consciousness and liberates it from bonds of ignorance, Lilith liberates the soul from illusions of the flesh and awakens spiritual desire. She and Samael/Lucifer can be compared to two snakes that constitute the Tantric concept of the Kundalini: Ida – the lunar feminine force, and Pingala – the solar masculine current. The image of their union and the encircling force is Leviathan, the principle of continuity and ageless existence."
    },
    {
      "term": "Liminal",
      "definition": "Referring to the condition of “in-between” – between day and night, waking and sleeping, conscious and unconscious, etc. Liminality is the quality of disorientation that occurs during a trance state or an altered state of mind. It is also called a “threshold\" condition, as the mind is at this moment neither in one state nor the other, but experiencing a transition between them. Liminal deities, like Hecate, are those that walk between worlds and dimensions, belonging to neither, and preside over the threshold moments and conditions."

In the Qabalah, he is associated with the hidden Sephira Daath, which descended to the level of man, awakening the forbidden power of creation, which is represented by the fruits of knowledge offered to man by the Serpent in the Garden of Eden. In old grimoires and books of magic, Lucifer is the King of Hell, Infernal Emperor presiding over the entire infernal hierarchy. In traditional demonology, he rules the element of air and the direction of East, while three other infernal kings preside over the remaining elements and directions: Leviathan (water, West), Belial (earth, North), and Satan (fire, South). In the Draconian Tradition, especially in the ritual system of the Temple of Ascending Flame, he is the Emperor of the Nightside, which is his primal form that predates Christian legends. He and Lilith can be compared to two serpents that constitute the Kundalini concept in Tantra: the lunar and the solar currents of Pingala and Ida uniting in the Third Eye, the center of awakened consciousness, where the Fire Snake spreads its wings and becomes the Dragon. In a similar way, Lilith and Lucifer are thought to be two parts of the same force, personifications of the feminine and masculine currents of the Dragon, the lunar and solar forces existing at the foundations of the universe."

As he is not born in a natural way but rips himself violently out of his mother's womb, he represents an archetype of a self-created being. As the slayer of Osiris, which is symbolic of the defeat of stasis and shattering the old thought patterns he represents triumph over death itself. He is the giver of the Black Flame and the destroyer of obstacles on the path to self-deification.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This glossary is highly relevant for practitioners and serious students of modern Draconian magic, especially those engaged with the 'Temple of Ascending Flame' system. It provides essential definitions that clarify the specific philosophical and operative framework of this tradition, often offering unique interpretations of widely recognized occult and mythological terms. Its focus on Kundalini (Serpent/Dragon Force), Qliphoth, and self-deification grounds it firmly within Left Hand Path esotericism, distinguishing its approach from more generalized occult practices.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes advanced practitioners of Western Esotericism, occultists specializing in Left Hand Path traditions, Qliphothic Qabalah, Chaos Magic, and those specifically following or researching the Draconian Tradition or the Temple of Ascending Flame. It presupposes a foundational understanding of occult concepts and provides deeper insights into a specialized magical current."
