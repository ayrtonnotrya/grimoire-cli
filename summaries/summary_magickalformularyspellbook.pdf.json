The practitioner's intent and willpower are central to empowering the workings, often amplified through color correspondence, astrological timing (e.g., dark moon for Black Arts), and the use of personal concerns (names, bodily fluids, hair). The emphasis is on direct, practical results for mundane life problems.",
