      "chapter_title": "ABSTRACT",
      "summary": "The study examined perceptual and memory capabilities of AVP witnesses across four experiments. No significant differences were found between witnesses and non-witnesses on any task. However, medium- and large-sized effects suggested that witnesses might require less time to recall specific memories, be more likely to identify abstract objects as legitimate, require fewer presentations to identify fragmented objects, and be more prone to misidentifying ambiguous objects. The findings offer weak support for the involvement of perceptual and memory variables in AVP perception."

      "chapter_title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "summary": "This section outlines various explanations for anomalous visual phenomena (AVP), including literal reality, hoaxes, hallucinatory, and illusionary hypotheses. It highlights the lack of empirical research on perceptual and cognitive abilities in AVP witnesses, proposing that misinterpretations of mundane objects due to reduced recognition, predisposition to identifying meaningless objects, or enhanced creativity could explain AVP sightings. The study aims to fill this gap."

    {
      "chapter_title": "GENERAL METHODS",
      "summary": "Describes the participant recruitment process, forming a witness group (19 participants) and a non-witness control group (19 participants), ensuring the witness group had frequent AVP experiences. It details the qualitative survey used to identify AVP witnesses and the statistical analysis methods (SPSS, Cohen's d, GPower) applied across the four experiments."

    {
      "chapter_title": "EXPERIMENT 1",
      "summary": "Investigated witnesses' ability to recall specific autobiographical memories triggered by pictures of common objects, hypothesizing a reduced capacity in witnesses. While no significant differences were found in the number of specific or categoric memories, a medium effect size for Reaction Time (RT) suggested witnesses might require less time to access specific memories."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "EXPERIMENT 2",
      "summary": "Explored implicit memory by examining performance on a picture discrimination task after subliminal priming, hypothesizing witnesses would be inferior. No significant difference was found between groups, but a large effect size suggested witnesses might actually be more accurate, implying superior generation or utilization of implicit memories."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "EXPERIMENT 3",
      "summary": "Examined witnesses' ability to recognize genuine objects in unusual contexts and differentiate them from abstract objects. No significant difference was found for genuine objects. However, group differences approached significance for abstract objects, with witnesses less accurately identifying them as 'not real', suggesting a more lax criterion for what constitutes a genuine visual stimulus."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "EXPERIMENT 4",
      "summary": "Tested witnesses' ability to identify fragmented and ambiguous objects, hypothesizing they would require more information and make more false identifications. No significant difference was found for correct identification, but a medium effect size for misidentifications suggested witnesses might be more prone to misidentifying fragmented objects, indicating a propensity for hasty conclusions."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "GENERAL DISCUSSION",
      "summary": "Summarizes that formal analyses showed no significant differences, but various medium- and large-sized effects point to potential tendencies. Witnesses might have superior access to autobiographical memories and identify fragmented objects more quickly, yet also be more prone to identifying abstract objects as legitimate and misidentifying ambiguous ones. These tendencies align with theories of intolerance of ambiguity and transliminality, suggesting a complex interplay of psycho-perceptual characteristics in AVP perception. Future research with greater power and more complex stimuli is recommended."

      "term": "Tolerance of Ambiguity",
      "definition": "A personality variable reflecting an individual's inclination to either quickly draw conclusions or resist concluding when faced with ambiguous information; low tolerance is associated with hasty interpretations and reluctance to surrender initial solutions."

      "term": "Transliminality",
      "definition": "A psychological construct describing a hypothesized reduction in inhibitory processes, leading to increased flow of information from the external environment, internal states, and subliminal perceptions; potentially associated with greater access to unconscious material and anomalous experiences."

It is a psychological study investigating the perceptual and memory capabilities of individuals who report seeing anomalous visual phenomena (AVP), offering scientific explanations rather than engaging with magical systems, philosophies, or operative practices. It treats AVP as misperceptions or psychological experiences, not as manifestations requiring magical intervention or understanding. The concepts discussed, such as explicit memory, implicit memory, and tolerance of ambiguity, are framed within a cognitive psychology paradigm and do not describe esoteric principles or magical mechanics. Therefore, it does not contribute to the understanding or practice of Western Esotericism, Occultism, or Magic.",
