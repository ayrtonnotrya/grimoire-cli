  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book presents a practical, eclectic system of spellcraft centered on the practitioner's will, intent, and visualization.

The system encourages personalization of spells and rituals, drawing from diverse folk magic traditions (Wiccan, Hoodoo, ceremonial magic). A key aspect is the preparation and 'charging' of tools and ingredients to imbue them with personal and universal energies. Protection and countermagick are also integral components, acknowledging the reality of negative magical influences and providing methods to defend against them. The practitioner is encouraged to maintain a 'Book of Shadows' to record and evolve their personal practice.",
