    "description": "Regina Milbourne's practical system is a highly adaptive, client-centric approach to psychic and magical work, drawing on her intuitive 'God-given gift' and integrating elements from Gypsy, Santeria, and Voodoo traditions. The core philosophy posits that genuine efficacy stems from 'faith in God' and the client's sincere commitment to change. Regina functions as a spiritual counselor, offering tailored 'spells' and 'rituals' often priced according to client's perceived wealth and the complexity of their case. Her practice emphasizes the reciprocal energetic influence between psychic and client, requiring the client's active participation and genuine desire for resolution. Ethical boundaries are constantly tested, leading Regina to a personal crisis and a re-evaluation of her practice towards 'nobler pursuits.'",

      "Protection Spells (Generic): Involve prolonged meditation, building an 'atmosphere of electrical energy,' daily prayers (often seven days), lighting candles, and cleansing with 'oils and white roses.' More elaborate versions for 'extended coverage' (costing $150,000) include sweat lodge ceremonies, crafting 'prayer chains' from tobacco and prayers, and using one hundred and twenty Tibetan bowls. A simpler variant involves binding an object representing the feared person with black ribbon, writing names with blessed ink, and burying it in a 'sacred place' under a waxing moon (costing $15,000).",
      "Mal Occhio (Evil Eye) Removal: Methods range from asking 'God's forgiveness through special prayers' and bathing in holy water for several weeks, to more extreme acts like traveling to the 'site of the mal occhio's origin' and being 'spat on by the descendants' of the curse caster.",
      "Soul-Cleansing/Image Renewal: A week-long ritual involving sleeping naked in white cloth with fresh herbs to absorb impurity. Negative words ('depression, sadness,' etc.) are written on the cloth, which is then rolled down a hill naked by the client and burned at a sacred beach. This is combined with purchasing new clothes, special baths, and prayers for forgiveness. The aim is to renew the spirit, self-esteem, and avoid illness.",
      "Love Spells (for Conception): A complex ritual requiring a handwritten, sincere letter detailing desires, 35 plucked hairs, first names and birthdates of all involved in the 'love triangle,' seven tears on a paper napkin, the husband's 'essence' from unwashed sheets, his bar of soap, a dozen red roses, and red candles (one for each year of life). The psychic fasts and prays intensely for three days. The client is instructed to soak for an hour in a mixture of honey, sugar, and molasses before the 'date' to make the target 'dreamy and receptive.'",
      "Reiki: A long-distance healing technique performed using a client's photograph to purify, clear, and break up negative energies on physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual levels.",
      "Putting Souls to Rest: For deceased individuals, this Cuban ritual involves writing an apology and declaration of love to the deceased, including a picture of both, placing it on a tray with a special candle, praying for the immortal soul, and setting it free into the ocean, typically on 'All Souls’ Day' under a full moon.",
      "Binding Evil Spirits (Voodoo influenced): Utilizes a picture of the target, white ribbon, sage, sulfur, mercury, and petrified wood. The ribbon is bound around the picture while chanting, 'I bind you and all of your evil. You will not harm [target]; she is a child of God.' The bound item is then burned to create light that repels darkness.",
      "Exorcism (Haitian Voodoo): Performed by a Voodoo King (Azzaca), involving dramatic rituals to remove ancestral curses and negative spirits. This includes symbolic acts like plunging a knife into the client's heart (without causing physical harm) and chanting in Creole. This service is noted as 'very expensive.'",
      "Protection against Organized Crime (Red Mafia): A specific ritual involving burying bullets (from the client's gun) and a napkin containing the client's perspiration under the grave of an 'eldest baby' in a sacred cemetery to summon spirits for protection against physical harm."

Its raw, unfiltered narrative is relevant for scholars and practitioners seeking to understand the socio-economic and ethical dimensions of contemporary magic, particularly in urban settings. It illuminates the practical application of various magical systems, the psychological burden on practitioners, and the often-dark motivations of clients, moving beyond idealized portrayals of psychic services. The book also provides valuable insights into cultural syncretism in occult practices and the personal struggle for authenticity and spiritual integrity in a marketplace driven by greed and desperation.",

Additionally, readers interested in memoir, true crime, and narratives exploring the psychological and ethical challenges of spiritual work will find it compelling. It appeals to those curious about the 'underbelly' of commercial psychic services and the personal journey of a practitioner grappling with moral dilemmas and seeking spiritual redemption."
