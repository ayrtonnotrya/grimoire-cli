      "term": "Multiple Signifiers",
      "definition": "A divinatory method or reading technique that utilizes more than one primary symbolic element or indicator (e.g., cards, runes) within a single session to provide nuanced insights into a 'Question'. The exercises imply a system where various elements are interpreted in relation to each other and specific positional meanings."

      "term": "Exit Ritual, Day Greetings and Day Endings",
      "definition": "A prescribed set of daily magical or spiritual practices. 'Day Greetings' and 'Day Endings' are performed at the beginning and end of the day, respectively, likely for grounding, protection, or intention setting. The 'Exit Ritual' is typically performed to close sacred space or conclude magical work, signaling a return to ordinary consciousness."

      "term": "Book of Shadows",
      "definition": "A personal magical journal or grimoire used by practitioners to record all aspects of their magical work, including rituals performed, spells cast, divinatory readings, magical experiences, interpretations, and learned occult knowledge. The text mandates its use for recording reading results and interpretations."

      "definition": "A specific divinatory layout composed of twelve distinct positions, systematically divided into 'Past Line' (positions 1-4), 'Present Line' (positions 5-8), and 'Future Line' (positions 9-12). Each position holds a specific interpretive significance within its respective temporal context."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system outlined is a pragmatic framework for integrating daily magical rituals with advanced divinatory practice and meticulous record-keeping. It mandates adherence to specific daily 'Exit Ritual, Day Greetings and Day Endings' to establish a consistent energetic and spiritual foundation. The core operative aspect involves performing 'multiple signifier' readings, specifically detailing a '12 Card Spread' for comprehensive analysis across past, present, and future temporal lines. The system heavily emphasizes the recording of both the reading results and their interpretations in a 'Book of Shadows' or provided forms, fostering a systematic approach to learning, self-reflection, and tracking magical progress. This methodology aims to develop intuitive interpretation skills while ensuring a disciplined, traceable magical practice.",
