    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant to contemporary esoteric practice by providing a visually rich and philosophically grounded Tarot system that bridges ancient Celtic spirituality with modern self-development and magical application. It offers a tangible framework for connecting with nature, ancestral wisdom, and personal archetypal energies in an increasingly disconnected world. Its emphasis on cyclical time and natural rhythms makes it particularly resonant for those seeking a more integrated, earth-centered spiritual path.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes practitioners of Wicca, Druidry, Neo-Paganism, and other forms of nature-based spirituality, as well as those interested in Celtic mythology and folklore. It also appeals to Tarot enthusiasts seeking a deck with a strong thematic focus and a system for practical magic, shamanic journeying, and personal growth rooted in Western Esotericism and occult traditions."
