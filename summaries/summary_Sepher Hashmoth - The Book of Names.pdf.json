Each entry includes pronunciation, Hebrew script, a numerical value (Gematria), a meaning, and a scriptural reference, forming a comprehensive lexicon intended for spiritual application within the 'Work of the Chariot' tradition, particularly in conjunction with their 'Angelic Tree Language' system.",

      "summary": "The introductory section establishes the provenance of this compilation, identifying it as a complete list of 'Divine Names' from the 1970s 'Work of the Chariot Trust' edition of 'Sefer HaShmoth'. It explicitly links these names to the 'Angelic Tree Language of Working and Perfect Trees' and 'Qabalah: The Mystical Heritage of the Children of Abraham', thereby placing the document within a specific esoteric tradition. The attribution to 'Master Adam' suggests a lineage claiming primordial or archetypal knowledge."

      "summary": "The main body of the document consists of a meticulously organized table. Each entry in the catalog provides a 'Pronunciation' (transliterated Hebrew), the 'HEBREW' spelling, a numerical value ('#', indicative of Gematria), the 'MEANING' of the name, and a 'TENAKH' (Old Testament) scriptural reference where the name or concept appears. This systematic presentation facilitates both scholarly study and practical application of the Divine Names."

      "term": "Divine Names",
      "definition": "Specific Hebrew words or phrases understood as direct emanations or aspects of the Divine.

      "term": "Gematria",
      "definition": "An esoteric system of assigning numerical values to Hebrew letters, words, and phrases. The '#' column in the document directly corresponds to this practice, indicating that the numerical significance of each Divine Name is a crucial aspect of its mystical interpretation and application."

    {
      "term": "Tanakh",
      "definition": "The Hebrew Bible, comprising the Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim. It serves as the authoritative scriptural source for the Divine Names listed, providing their traditional context and often their earliest recorded usage, grounding the esoteric system in established religious texts."

      "term": "Angelic Tree Language",
      "definition": "A specialized system developed by the 'Work of the Chariot' tradition, which utilizes the Divine Names in conjunction with 'Working and Perfect Trees'.

    "description": "While not a 'how-to' manual itself, 'Sefer HaShmoth: Book of the Names' is a foundational operative text that provides the core vocabulary for a practical Qabalistic system. It meticulously catalogs Divine Names, their Gematric values, meanings, and scriptural references, which are essential for engaging with the 'Angelic Tree Language of Working and Perfect Trees' developed by the Work of the Chariot. The system implicitly involves the study, meditation, and ritual application of these names to access specific divine energies or angelic intelligences, often aligned with the Sephiroth and paths of the Qabalistic Tree of Life.",

    "relevance": "This document is profoundly relevant for serious students and practitioners of Qabalah and Western Esotericism, particularly those interested in the 'Work of the Chariot' tradition. It serves as an essential reference for understanding the specific Divine Names, their Gematric values, and scriptural contexts as presented within this particular school. Its systematic approach to compiling these names makes it a valuable resource for ritual magic, meditation, and theological study, providing the raw material for advanced mystical work. The direct correlation to biblical passages grounds these esoteric concepts in traditional scripture, enhancing their perceived authenticity and power.",

It is designed for those seeking a deep, technical understanding and practical application of Divine Names in their spiritual and magical practices, rather than a general introduction to mysticism."
