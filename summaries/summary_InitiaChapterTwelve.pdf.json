This limitation is presented as a safeguard against chaos, comparing the brain's function to a 'marvelous computer' for choices and imagination to a 'fitting room' for ideas, emphasizing the orderly nature of the physical world."

It provides detailed instructions for its use, including practicing instant creation (e.g., an orange) with full sensory engagement to develop belief. Guidelines for inviting non-human and human entities for various purposes, along with essential protective measures (e.g., armor of light, specific inscriptions), are outlined."

It connects these motives to an amplified version of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, suggesting that true self-actualization for a Witch extends beyond basic material desires."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The 'Initia General Theory' posits a two-tiered system of manifestation: limited and non-instantaneous in physical reality, but unlimited and instantaneous within the Astral Temple. The core practice involves cultivating the Astral Temple as a sacred space to act as a template for desired reality. By practicing instantaneous creation with full sensory immersion in the Astral Temple, practitioners accelerate their magickal abilities and build a powerful mental belief system that then facilitates manifestation in the physical world through a 'deliberate link.' This system emphasizes intention, belief, imagination, and ethical conduct, especially when interacting with other entities.",
