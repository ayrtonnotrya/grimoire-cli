  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The primary practical system presented is 'The Next Step Method' for Tarot reading, designed to address situations where a client feels 'stuck.' It begins with a three-card spread representing the current state, followed by the systematic placement of a 'next' card for each, based on its sequential order within the Minor, Court, or Major Arcana. The practitioner then analyzes each card pair to discern the 'in-between' actions or transformations needed to move from the current card to its 'next step' equivalent. This method encourages the reader to develop a narrative combining these insights to provide actionable advice. Additionally, the text extensively details the practical application of 'Elemental Dignity,' a Golden Dawn system for interpreting card relationships based on their elemental associations (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) and their interactions (oppositions, supports). This allows for a nuanced understanding of how cards influence each other within a spread, informing the magician about underlying energetic dynamics.",
