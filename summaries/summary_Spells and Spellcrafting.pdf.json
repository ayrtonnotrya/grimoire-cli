The author extensively provides lists of these to guide spell creation."

    {
      "term": "Focus and Visualization",

      "term": "Personal Interpretation",

      "term": "The Cautioning Rede",
      "definition": "A personal poem by Eliza Fegley that critically re-evaluates the commonly accepted 'Wiccan Rede.'

  ],
  "practical_system": {
    "description": "Eliza Fegley's practical system is a form of intuitive, personal, and highly adaptable modern spellcrafting rooted in Kitchen Witch principles. It centers on the conscious direction of will through 'Focus' (clear intent) and 'Visualization' (mental manifestation), amplified by the strategic use of 'Correspondences' (colors, herbs, stones, moon/sun phases, natural items). The system encourages sympathetic magic, where symbolic actions and objects are used to influence reality. A core tenet is 'personal interpretation,' empowering practitioners to find what resonates with them and to adapt or create their own rituals and spells, making the practice deeply individual and experiential.",

    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant to modern practitioners of witchcraft, particularly those within the Kitchen Witch, eclectic Wiccan, and solitary practitioner traditions. It provides a grounded, accessible framework for spellcrafting that prioritizes personal intuition and practical application over complex ceremonial structures. By emphasizing the adaptable nature of magic and the importance of individual interpretation, Eliza Fegley’s writings offer a refreshing counterpoint to more rigid grimoire traditions. Her direct address of plagiarism also highlights ongoing issues of intellectual property and community ethics within online magical spheres, making the document historically significant to the development of digital occult communities. The blend of earnest instruction with satirical pieces demonstrates a nuanced understanding of magical practice that embraces both reverence and lightheartedness.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of beginner to intermediate practitioners of modern witchcraft and Wicca, Kitchen Witches, and individuals seeking a personal, intuitive, and highly adaptable system of magic. It also caters to those who appreciate a less dogmatic approach, perhaps solitary practitioners or members of small, informal covens. The humorous and self-aware entries (e.g., 'Condom of Change Spell', 'Military Commands') also appeal to practitioners with a sense of humor about their craft, suggesting a community that values both serious practice and playful exploration of magical concepts."
