      "chapter_title": "Lesson Twenty Six: JUSTICE",
      "summary": "This lesson delves into the symbolism of Tarot Key 11, Justice. It highlights its connection to the Law of Equilibrium, duality, polarity, and the serpent power. The background color, yellow, signifies the same energy as Keys 1 and 8. The violet curtains represent duality and vibration, complementary to the yellow, and symbolize the mechanical aspect of manifestation veiling conscious identity. The throne's pillars with pomegranates signify fruition. The triple ornament on the crown refers to the serpent power's ability to release consciousness from three-dimensional interpretations. The circle and square on the crown represent Spirit within form, connecting to Key 10 and the four mystical animals. The ornament on Justice's breast, a T-cross with an ellipse in indigo (Saturn's color), links to mathematical elements and Saturn's exaltation in Libra. The sword's steel blade, ruled by Mars, signifies the active interplay of Venus and Mars forces, particularly relevant to Libra. The sword-hilt, a T-cross, also relates to Saturn and symbolizes alchemical transmutation. The letter Zain corresponds to the sword, representing elimination and purification, analogous to the kidneys' function in maintaining blood equilibrium. The scales symbolize weighing and measuring, representing mental powers and the equilibration of complementary activities corresponding to the 22 Hebrew alphabet letters and Tarot Keys. The golden pans signify radiant solar energy. The seven equal lines of the scales refer to seven Life-Power aspects (Keys 1, 2, 3, 10, 16, 19, 21), seven alchemical metals, seven body centers, and Libra as the seventh zodiacal sign. The seven equal lines also hint at the number 10 and the heptagon, a basis for alchemical diagrams. In occult arithmetic, 10 and 7 are related (sum of 0-7 is 28, digits sum to 10). Justice weighs the manifestation of Key 7's personal activities, which are cosmic operations. The direction NW is assigned to Lamed and Key 11, connecting the western face (Kaph, Key 10) with the northern face (Peh, Key 16, Mars) and Jupiter (Key 10). The sword (Mars) is on the northern side, and the scales (balance) are in the other hand, representing the sphere/wheel. NW connects the western ends of lines for Keys 8 (conscious) and 9 (subconscious), signifying the culmination of their activities, which is the modification of Karma by right judgment. Key 11 connects the northern ends of West-Above (Key 14) and West-Below (Key 15). The green cape symbolizes Venus and Libra. The red robe signifies the Mars force energizing the muscular system via adrenals, relating to work. The stone dais and throne represent the Law of Equilibrium in the mineral kingdom, emphasizing that physical plane experience is sufficient for understanding this law. The lesson encourages careful consideration of actions, earnest daily tasks, poised and quiet work, dismissing anxiety and haste, fashioning clear mental images of desires, and viewing them as present realities."

      "chapter_title": "THE SECRET OF WORK",
      "summary": "This section clarifies the concept of Karma, differentiating it from Fate or Nemesis. Primarily, Karma means 'action' and secondarily 'work' (attributed to the letter Lamed). The Law of Karma is not merely 'action and reaction are equal' but involves modification by subsequent action. Like separating wheat from tares, consequences of past actions can be changed by present choices. The Western School emphasizes that while we cannot escape past results, we can change them through present actions. This involves weighing present conditions, striking a balance, using discrimination (the sword) to eliminate mistaken thoughts/actions, and cultivating positive thinking and action. The text asserts that each individual is a unit within the One Self, and all individuals affect Humanity. We participate in group karma, both positive and negative. The call to action is to work unceasingly to transmute our thinking, feeling, and doing, thereby modifying individual and world Karma. It references Jesus's statement about being lifted up and drawing all men, urging the use of Key 11 to evoke favorable reactions for this mental attitude, to be practiced until it becomes subconscious nature. The real Actor/Thinker is the all-wise Self, not the personality."
