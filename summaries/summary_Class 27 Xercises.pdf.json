      "summary": "This section details a structured approach to preparing and executing a candle spell. It begins with foundational rituals (Exit Ritual, Day Greetings, Day Endings) and progresses to defining the specific purpose of the candle spell, noting its suitability for complex or obstinate situations. The core of the preparation involves a series of diagnostic and prognostic Tarot readings: a 'base 12-card reading' to understand the spell's topic and identify obstacles (reverse flow lines); a subsequent 'spell efficacy reading' (using the 'Magi' card) to determine if the spell will work and what issues it can or cannot handle; and finally, iterative 'directors and limiters readings' to fine-tune the spell's precise instructions and boundaries. This iterative process, guided by Tarot feedback, aims to ensure clarity and address potential troubles, adjusting directors and limiters until readings show a clear path."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system described is an iterative, diagnostic, and prescriptive process for designing and refining candle spells. It begins with preparatory rituals, moves to defining a clear spell purpose, and then utilizes a series of specific 12-card Tarot readings—a base reading for situational diagnosis, an efficacy reading for prognosis, and iterative directors/limiters readings for refinement—to guide the spell's development. The readings provide feedback on obstacles (reversed cards/flow lines) and potential issues, leading to adjustments in the spell's 'directors' (desired outcomes) and 'limiters' (boundaries) until the magical plan is optimized and predicted to be effective.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This text presents a highly methodical and analytical system for spell design, emphasizing diagnosis, prognosis, and iterative refinement. This contrasts with more intuitive or purely ritualistic approaches, aligning instead with results-oriented magical paradigms such as some forms of Chaos Magic or ceremonial magic that stress precise planning and feedback. The heavy reliance on Tarot as a diagnostic and feedback mechanism provides a practical framework for practitioners to identify potential challenges, refine their magical intent, and optimize the parameters of their operations (directors and limiters). Its relevance lies in offering a structured problem-solving approach to magic, aiming to enhance efficacy and reduce unforeseen complications.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience consists of practitioners of Western Esotericism and Occultism who are engaged in practical spellcasting and seek a structured, analytical, and self-correcting methodology for their magical work. This system is particularly suited for individuals comfortable with Tarot divination, interested in understanding the 'mechanics' of their spells, and committed to a disciplined, iterative process of magical development and refinement within a formal training context, such as a school of magic."
