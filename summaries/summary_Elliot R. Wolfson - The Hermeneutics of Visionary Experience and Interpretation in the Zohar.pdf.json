  "central_thesis": "The paper argues that in the Zohar, the traditional distinction between divine revelation and human interpretation is collapsed; instead, these two modes are identified and intertwined, such that mystical exegesis of sacred texts becomes a vehicle for visionary experience of the divine, enabling the kabbalist to achieve a prophetic state akin to Moses at Sinai.",

      "chapter_title": "Introduction",
      "summary": "This section introduces the historical paradox in Judaism concerning the legitimization of new insights—either through direct revelation or exegetical derivation from ancient texts. The author notes the common assumption that these modalities are mutually exclusive, but posits that in the Zohar, a convergence occurs, rooted in a shared phenomenological basis provided by its theosophic structure."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Revelation",
      "summary": "Wolfson meticulously analyzes the Zoharic understanding of Sinaitic revelation, particularly Ex. 20:15, 'And all the people saw the voices.' The Zohar offers multiple interpretations, ultimately emphasizing a visual perception of the divine. R. Jose's view states that the 'voices' were the Sefirot themselves, luminous potencies seen directly. R. Eleazar's interpretation, building on Bahiric and 13th-century Kabbalistic thought (e.g., R. Ezra, Nahmanides), posits that the vision was mediated through the Shekhinah, the tenth sefirah, referred to as the 'mirror of the upper colors.' This places Sinaitic prophecy, for most Israelites, within the spectrum of normal prophetic experience (excluding Moses, who saw through Tiferet), where Shekhinah serves as the 'objective correlate' of vision. The vision had a gnostic element, imparting esoteric knowledge of the divine attributes and the secrets of the Torah embedded within the Decalogue."

      "chapter_title": "Interpretation",
      "summary": "This section details how kabbalistic exegesis in the Zohar imitates the Sinaitic revelation. Through intense study of Torah, the mystic (maskil) gains a vision of the divine Glory (Shekhinah), akin to the Israelites at Sinai. Torah study is portrayed not merely as an intellectual pursuit but as a means to behold the divine light hidden within the text itself, for the letters are 'configurations of that light.' The Zohar posits that the Torah in its mystical essence is identical with God and the Sefirot. By contemplating the esoteric sense, the kabbalist removes the 'mask' from the Torah, seeing God. This process of interpretation leads to devekut (cleaving/union) with the Shekhinah, elevating the exegete to a level surpassing ordinary prophets, reaching the level of Moses, who is also called 'master of the house' or 'husband of Torah.' The mystic, like Yesod, acts as a conduit unifying the masculine (Written Torah/Tiferet) and feminine (Oral Torah/Shekhinah) divine aspects."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The Zoharic system, as presented by Wolfson, establishes mystical exegesis (Midrash) as the core practical method for achieving visionary experience of the divine. This system views the Torah not merely as a set of laws or narratives but as a living entity, identical with God and the Sefirot, composed of configurations of divine light. The operative goal is to 'see' this hidden divine light within the text, thereby penetrating its multiple layers of meaning to reach its esoteric depths. This process leads to Devekut (mystical union) with the Shekhinah, the divine feminine Presence, and a prophetic state where the kabbalist becomes a 'master of Torah' akin to Moses.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant to Western Esotericism, particularly Qabalah, as it meticulously outlines the Zoharic paradigm shift where ongoing mystical experience and direct divine vision are not historical relics but living, attainable states through textual engagement. It redefines prophecy, legitimizing new insights by collapsing the traditional chasm between ancient revelation and contemporary gnosis. This concept provides a foundational framework for many subsequent Qabalistic and magical systems that emphasize visualization, inner light work, and the manipulation of divine names/energies through sacred texts. The paper implicitly establishes the Zohar as not just a commentary but a new revelation, thereby setting a precedent for other esoteric texts that claim revelatory status through interpretation. It underpins practices where the study of sacred texts is itself a form of operative magic, transforming the practitioner into a conduit for divine flow.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience is academic scholars of Jewish mysticism, Kabbalah, and the phenomenology of religious and esoteric experience. For practitioners of Western Esotericism, especially those engaged in Qabalistic or Hermetic traditions, it offers a sophisticated theoretical framework for understanding how textual work (e.g., contemplation of Hebrew letters, divine names, or symbolic diagrams) can be understood as a powerful form of visionary and unitive praxis, akin to prophetic revelation. It provides a deep dive into the underlying philosophy of how text-based magic can operate, offering context for techniques involving sacred language and script."
