The system also includes instructions for banishing negative influences and even therapeutic uses for emotional processing, always under the strict warning of karmic repercussions for malevolent practices.",

The emphasis on karmic responsibility and 'right-hand' practice aligns it with contemporary ethical magic movements and provides a framework for safe and constructive engagement.",

It caters to those seeking hands-on instructions for crafting magical tools, understanding the historical and cultural context of New Orleans Voodoo, and learning ethical applications for personal growth, healing, and positive manifestation. It also appeals to individuals who wish to understand Voodoo practice beyond media stereotypes and those exploring syncretic spiritual traditions, including the integration of Catholic elements."
