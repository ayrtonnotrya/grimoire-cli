Cultivating a close, warmhearted feeling for others automatically puts the mind at ease. It helps remove whatever fears or insecurities we may have and gives us the strength to cope with any obstacles we encounter. It is the principal source of success in life. Since we are not solely material creatures, it is a mistake to place all our hopes for happiness on external development alone. The key is to develop inner peace.",

Its relevance lies in illustrating how various spiritual traditions are integrated and applied in daily life by practitioners seeking personal growth and connection to a broader spiritual network.",

The inclusive language and 'open policy' suggest an appeal to anyone interested in exploring alternative spiritual paths in a supportive, non-judgmental environment."
