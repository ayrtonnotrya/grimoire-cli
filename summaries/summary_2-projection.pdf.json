    {
      "chapter_title": "Astral Projection",
      "summary": "Defines astral projection as consciously leaving the physical body for the Astral plane, contrasting it with unconscious projection during sleep.

      "chapter_title": "The Problem of the Chattering mind",

      "chapter_title": "Exercise 3: A Technique for Astral Projection – Concentration on the Heart",
      "summary": "Presents a primary astral projection technique: concentrating on the heartbeat. It describes common sensations during the projection process (heaviness/lightness, whirring noises, electric sensations, rising) and how to verify separation in the Astral."

      "chapter_title": "Ways to Concentrate on the Heart",
      "summary": "Provides five distinct methods for concentrating on the heart: feeling its beats, visualizing the physical organ, imagining oneself as the heart, visualizing the physical body as a heart, and visualizing the heart as a temple. Practitioners are encouraged to experiment."
