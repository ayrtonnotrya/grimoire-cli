Key fields include 'Signifier' (the card representing the querent or core issue), 'Date' of the reading, and the 'Question' posed. The template visually represents the Celtic Cross spread layout, allowing for the specific placement of cards in positions such as 'Cover' and 'Cross,' as well as the 'Sig' (Signifier) position within the spread itself."

It requires the practitioner's 'Name/Sun Sign' and is structured with two columns: 'Position' and 'Interpretation.' Specific positions for interpretation include 'Cover,' 'Cross,' 'Behind,' 'Above,' 'Below,' 'Ahead,' 'Far Past,' 'Near Past,' 'Near Future,' and 'Far Future.' This template serves as a guide for systematically analyzing the meaning of each card within its designated position relative to the querent's situation."
