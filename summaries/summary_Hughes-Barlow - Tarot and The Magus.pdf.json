      "term": "Unaspected Cards",
      "definition": "Cards within a 'String' that are not 'hit' by the counting technique in either clockwise or anticlockwise directions.

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The core practical system revolves around the 'Opening of the Key Spread' (OOTK), which deploys the entire 78-card Tarot deck into four elemental 'piles' or 'Strings.' The analysis of these Strings employs three primary Golden Dawn techniques: 'Pairing' (examining cards from extremities inward or from a central point to build narrative), 'Counting' (following numerical sequences from chosen cards to trace an unfolding story), and 'Elemental Dignities' (assessing card strength and interaction based on elemental compatibility within groups of three). The system emphasizes identifying 'Unaspected Cards' as conduits for spiritual influence or untapped potential, linking them to higher Kabbalistic realms and specific spirits (Goetic, Liber 231). The ultimate goal is not just divination but the systematic application of these techniques for self-initiation and direct contact with the Holy Guardian Angel, grounded in the Hegelian Dialectic and Tree of Life principles.",
