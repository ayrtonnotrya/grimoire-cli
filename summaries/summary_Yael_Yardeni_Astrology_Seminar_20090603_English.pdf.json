  "central_thesis": "Kabbalistic Astrology provides a unique framework for self-understanding and spiritual correction (Tikkun) by revealing the soul's blueprint. It differs from conventional astrology through its reliance on the Hebrew calendar, a distinctive 'three-column system' that assigns both external and internal elemental influences to each sign, and a foundational understanding of creation derived from the Sefer Yetzira, where Hebrew letters manifest astrological archetypes and corresponding physical and spiritual characteristics. The primary aim is to guide individuals toward rectifying imbalances and achieving spiritual growth through practical 'Spiritual Goals' and meditative practices.",

    "description": "The Kabbalistic astrological system is an operative framework for self-knowledge and 'Tikkun' (spiritual correction). It begins with identifying one's true astrological sign using the Hebrew calendar. This sign then reveals an individual's primary external elemental family and a complementary internal energy, providing a detailed blueprint of their soul's energetic makeup. Further insights are gained from the sign's controlling planet (and its creating Hebrew letter), associated body parts, and a specific 'Line of the Ana B'Koach.' The practical application involves conscious engagement with the 'Spiritual Goals' and meditative focus on the 'Tikkun Keyword' and the designated Ana B'Koach line to rectify inherent imbalances, transform negative traits, and manifest spiritual potential. The Sefer Yetzira's descriptions of Hebrew letters creating astrological phenomena provide a theoretical and perhaps meditative basis for understanding the underlying magical causality.",

      "text": "What makes Kabbalah unique to other spiritual systems is it's use of the three column system. Kabbalistic Astrology is no exception. Despite what we see at first glance, each sign is actually influenced by two elements, not just one. There is the external element, which is how we commonly identify the sign, and think about the sign in the grand scheme of things. However, each sign also has an internal energy that influences the sign's characteristics.",
