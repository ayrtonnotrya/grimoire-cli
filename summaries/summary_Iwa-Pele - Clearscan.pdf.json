Opèlè is both the wife of Ọ̀rúnmìlà and the word used to identify one of the tools used in divination.

Whereas, Ọ̀rúnmìlà sat down in his own house and anybody who wants to see Ọ̀rúnmìlà comes to his house. People come to see him where he sat down. He made offerings for people that made things well for them. So when Orisha is moving about, when anybody comes to meet Orisha, they might not find Orisha at home. In short, Ọ̀rúnmìlà is the elder of them all. Before we can praise any Orisha priest the priesthood must be supported by Ifá. Orisha is not complete without the support of Ifá.",

The real father that gives birth to the child, the child must not be arrogant with the parent. So the child after initiation must not be arrogant with the new father. The same thing applies to the mother. So the chief, the initiator stands as a father. So anything that a priest thinks that he should do for his father, he should do for his Olúwo. He should always try to do good for his Olúwo. It is then that things will go smoothly. Anybody who wants to follow Ifá should not be dubious. They must be a stable person, firm in their faith. So he must not see red and say it is black and he must not see black and say it is red. He must say exactly as things are. It is after doing this that Ifá will support this particular person. Stability is the important thing. That is if he does not tell lies, and does not tell lies to his Olúwo, his life will improve. So with that, anywhere one goes, Ifá is bound to give support and listen, Ifá will hear that person’s prayers. Anybody who follows Ifá should return to the home of their Olúwo each year and make an offering to Ifá. It is when that person is doing these things that the person will be able to solve their personal problems. So the reason for doing good to the Olúwo is because we want our Ifá to be kind with us in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening, as we have been kind to our parents.'",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book offers a critical first-person account of Ifá initiation, bridging the often-disparate worlds of African Traditional Religions and Western Esotericism. It's particularly relevant for occult practitioners as it details an operative system of spiritual transformation that is rarely described with such intimacy outside of practitioner circles. The author's attempts to contextualize Ifá concepts within frameworks like Kundalini, Jungian archetypes, and Taoism make it accessible to those with a background in Western occultism, while also highlighting the unique elements of Ifá. The emphasis on ethical behavior, self-mastery, and communal responsibility within a magical framework offers a practical guide for developing power with integrity, a crucial aspect often overlooked in superficial occult practices. Furthermore, its discussion of the preservation and adaptation of Ifá in the Americas (Lucumí, Santería) provides historical and cultural context for understanding the evolution of magical traditions.",
    "target_audience": "This book is ideally suited for advanced practitioners of Western Esotericism and occultism seeking to expand their knowledge into African Traditional Religions, particularly Ifá. It is also highly relevant for individuals undergoing personal spiritual transformation, scholars of comparative religion, anthropology, and those interested in the practical application of spiritual systems for personal and communal well-being. The self-study guides make it valuable for those wishing to embark on a structured, albeit uninitiated, path of engaging with these traditions."
