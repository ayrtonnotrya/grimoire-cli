It emphasizes self-deification, liberation, and the establishment of an 'Infernal Empire' on Earth, reflecting a post-modern, anti-authoritarian stance that seeks to 'rewrite everything' and challenge conventional reality maps.",

It demands a high tolerance for unconventional and psychologically challenging concepts, a willingness to engage in intense ritual work, and an openness to experiences that may induce mental and emotional distress ('madness'), making it unsuitable for beginners or those seeking light spiritual guidance."
