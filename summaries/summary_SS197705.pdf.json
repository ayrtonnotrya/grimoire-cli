It establishes four committees (Communications, Transportation, Food/Shelter/Medical Care, and Quality of Life) to research and develop multi-level action plans (Levels A-D, from severe global catastrophe to regional disruption) for various disaster scenarios."

It aims to prevent the High Priest, Executive Director, and Scroll Staff from being overwhelmed by correspondence, directing inquiries through ALP/OC to appropriate III°+ Initiates for response, thereby maintaining personal relationships within the evolving structure and allowing key figures to focus on other Temple work."

      "summary": "This article explores the nature and 'sex' of Set/HarWer, addressing the difficulty new Setians face in understanding these concepts, often influenced by Christian teachings. It defines Set as 'ageless Intelligence' and HarWer as Set's 'Opposite Self,' a 'strange and fitful presence.' Using wind as a symbolic analogy (Set as a gentle breeze, HarWer as a hurricane), the author argues against assigning gender or limited form to these entities, advocating for personal symbolic understanding that does not confine their true nature."

It's a snapshot of a vibrant, growing occult organization addressing both esoteric theory and real-world practicalities for its members.",
