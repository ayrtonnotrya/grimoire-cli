  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system is a deterministic form of cartomancy utilizing a standard deck of 52 playing cards. It relies on a fixed lexicon of meanings for each card, both upright and reversed, and a set of predefined spreads (layouts) that dictate the positional significance of the cards. The system aims for unambiguous interpretations, with instructions for combining card meanings based on their adjacency, suit, and numerical value. It posits that by following these precise rules, one can accurately 'read' the past, present, and future, and gain insight into specific questions.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "Wehman’s Fortune Telling with Cards stands as a significant artifact within the popular occult literature of its time, providing a window into how cartomancy was systematized and marketed to a broader public. Its attribution to Madame Camille Le Normand, even if loosely, connects it to a powerful lineage of professional diviners, lending it a veneer of historical authority. The emphasis on detailed, fixed significations for each card, including upright and reversed meanings, reflects a common approach in traditional cartomancy aimed at demystifying and standardizing interpretation. While not a grimoire in the traditional sense, it operates as a practical manual for a specific divinatory 'art,' mirroring the desire to codify esoteric knowledge into accessible systems. Its primary relevance today is historical, illustrating the popularization of esoteric practices and the evolution of divination manuals.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience is primarily the general public, including individuals new to divination or those seeking simple, accessible methods for personal fortune-telling. The clear, prescriptive instructions make it suitable for beginners or hobbyists rather than advanced occult practitioners seeking deep magical theory or complex ceremonial rituals. The emphasis on 'personal use' and 'not for resale' (though a modern disclaimer on the OCR page, likely echoing original intent for private amusement) suggests it was intended for individual consultation and entertainment rather than professional client work or advanced magical operations."
