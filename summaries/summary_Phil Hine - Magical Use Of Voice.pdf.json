    "description": "Phil Hine's system for the magical use of voice is fundamentally experiential and pragmatic, rooted in the principle that the voice, through its non-semantic qualities (rhythm, tone, pacing), directly influences the 'Deep Mind' and induces altered states of consciousness. It integrates diverse techniques from global magical traditions (e.g., Tantrik, Amerindian) with modern understandings of psychology and performance. The system emphasizes intentionality, practice, and direct observation of effects, encouraging practitioners to adapt techniques to their own contexts rather than adhering to rigid dogma.",
