Kathleen Carter, Alfred Ligon, Luisah Teish, and Howard Thurman have similar perceptions. By way of the slaves from Africa, as early as the 1600s, ancient religious and mystical beliefs, practices, and observances of Africa were carried to the New World. The spiritual heritage of African Americans is in this way founded in the Group Spirit of ancestors whose religious precepts predate Western ones. Some metaphysicians see the roots of the planet's religions as beginning in Africa and India. African Americans thus reflect, to varying degrees in their beliefs and practices, the earliest religious and spiritual heritages of Earth's prerecorded history.",

It challenges Eurocentric biases in esoteric studies by presenting a rich tradition of indigenous spiritual practices, mediumship, healing, and visionary states deeply rooted in African heritage. The text's focus on personal narratives provides a unique phenomenological insight into operative magic and spiritual work, contextualizing practices often marginalized or misunderstood within broader occult discourse. It connects modern psychic abilities to ancestral lineages, ancient African religions (like Yoruba Orisha traditions), and foundational spiritual principles, demonstrating a continuity of magical thought and practice that predates many Western esoteric systems.",
