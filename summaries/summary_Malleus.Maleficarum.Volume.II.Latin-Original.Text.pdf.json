  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book does not present a system for practicing magic, but rather an elaborate, systematic *counter-system* designed for the identification, analysis, legal prosecution, and theological condemnation of all perceived forms of illicit magic and witchcraft. It functions as a comprehensive manual for inquisitors, theologians, and jurists to combat magical practices, rooted in a rigid Christian framework where all magic is ultimately demonic.

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This compilation is crucial for understanding the historical development of Christian demonology and the legal-theological foundations of the European witch hunts. It provides a comprehensive view of the inquisitorial mindset, detailing how authorities defined, identified, and prosecuted alleged magic users. For modern occultists, it serves as an inverse mirror, illustrating the historical suppression of magical practices and the theological framework magic had to contend with to survive. Its meticulous categorization of 'evil' magic ironically offers a detailed taxonomy of practices that, stripped of the demonic attribution, can be seen as forms of applied esotericism.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience was inquisitors, theologians, jurists, judges, and educated clergy during the Renaissance and early modern period. These individuals were tasked with identifying, prosecuting, and condemning practitioners of magic and witchcraft. In contemporary terms, it is a key resource for scholars of demonology, legal history, religious studies (particularly Christian polemics), and the history of Western esotericism and occultism."
