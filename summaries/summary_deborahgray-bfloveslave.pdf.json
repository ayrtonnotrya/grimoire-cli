    "relevance": "The book is highly relevant within the context of popular occultism and self-help literature focused on personal relationships. It taps into perennial human desires for love, connection, and control over romantic destiny, repackaging traditional folk magic and goddess worship into an accessible format. It aligns with modern trends of spiritual self-empowerment and practical magic, contrasting with more academic or dogmatic esoteric traditions. Its emphasis on 'awakening your Love Goddess' offers a narrative of internal empowerment rather than solely external manipulation, which resonates with contemporary spiritual seekers.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience consists primarily of beginners or casual practitioners interested in 'love magic,' likely individuals (predominantly women, given the direct address 'How to Turn Your Boyfriend...') seeking practical, low-barrier magical solutions for romantic issues. The tone is light, encouraging, and non-intimidating, avoiding complex occult jargon or demanding ceremonial structures. It appeals to those who prioritize immediate, tangible romantic outcomes over deep philosophical engagement with magical theory."
