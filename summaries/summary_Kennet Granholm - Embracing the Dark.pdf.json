    "description": "Dragon Rouge operates an 11-degree initiatory system, built upon the Qliphothic Tree of Knowledge. Progression involves self-study through correspondence courses, performing prescribed exercises, and submitting reports of experiences and reflections, with higher degrees requiring more personalized guidance. Rituals are largely improvised, allowing individual construction, focusing on direct experience and connection to 'chaos-forces' rather than rigid adherence to tradition. The core principles are vision, power, and action, aimed at transforming the magician into a 'creator of the future' and achieving self-deification.",
