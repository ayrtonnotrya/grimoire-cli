  "central_thesis": "Many Akkadian anti-witchcraft incantations, particularly within the *Maqlû* series, underwent significant revision and expansion over time. This process involved the secondary insertion of lengthy lists (of witches, demons, evils, ritual actions) into an earlier, shorter textual core. These interpolations frequently introduced internal inconsistencies and were often marked by repetitive resumptions (Wiederaufnahme) used by redactors to re-establish disrupted textual coherence. Such textual evolution reflects broader developments in religious thought and literary norms, including an expanded understanding of the witch's powers and the subordination of demonic forces.",

      "chapter_title": "Introduction",
      "summary": "This section outlines the methodological approach for identifying textual revisions in Akkadian incantations, primarily through extant variant forms and internal textual tensions. It introduces *Maqlû* as a prime example of a composition that evolved through sequential changes, often involving the expansion of shorter forms via interpolated lists and the use of 'Wiederaufnahme' (repetitive resumption). Examples from Maqlû III, V, and VII are cited to demonstrate how manuscript evidence and critical analysis support the theory of textual insertions and revisions."

      "chapter_title": "Analysis of Maqlû Tablet II 19–75",
      "summary": "A detailed critical analysis of this incantation reveals its hymnic invocation of the fire god Girra, followed by the victim's appeal for judgment and ritual action. The core ritual statement, involving the burning of bronze figurines representing witches, is shown to be extensively expanded by secondary interpolations. These include long lists enumerating various types of witches, demons, and illnesses, along with summary descriptions of the harm caused. The strategic placement of 'Wiederaufnahme' in lines 37/70 is identified as a redactor's device to reconnect the ritual's disrupted elements, supporting the argument for the secondary nature and complex layering of these lists. The inclusion of demons suggests an expansion of the perceived scope of a witch's powers."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Analysis of Maqlû Tablet IV 1–79",
      "summary": "This section analyzes another *Maqlû* incantation, demonstrating similar patterns of expansion. The original kernel, likely focused on binding witches and delivering them to Girra, is heavily augmented by an extensive catalogue of witchcraft activities (lines 10–73). Each listed act is typically followed by an antiphon ('You have performed against me... may Girra release'). The repetition of the binding statement from lines 7-8 to 74-75 acts as a 'Wiederaufnahme,' serving to re-establish the textual connection disrupted by the lengthy series of interpolations. This expansion aims to present a comprehensive enumeration of the witch's malevolent capabilities, reflecting a generalization of their power."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Conclusion",
      "summary": "The paper concludes by affirming that the analyzed *Maqlû* incantations are products of extensive textual expansion and secondary additions, though it acknowledges the theoretical possibility of initial composite authorship. It reiterates that when evidence points to redaction, repetitive resumptions serve as key indicators of revision. The study highlights that these ancient magical texts exemplify a dynamic interplay of continuity and innovation within the Mesopotamian magical tradition, showing how practices and beliefs evolved through textual adaptation."

    "description": "The paper analyzes the ancient Babylonian anti-witchcraft magical system as documented in the *Maqlû* series. This system is designed to counteract malevolent magic by ritually identifying, binding, and destroying witches (and associated evils) through the invocation of powerful deities. The underlying philosophy suggests that witchcraft is a tangible force that can be symbolically manipulated and neutralized through divine intervention and ritual actions. Over time, the scope of this system expanded to encompass a wider array of perceived threats, reflecting a developing understanding of the witch's capabilities to dispatch not only human-originated magic but also demonic forces and illnesses.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant to the study of Western Esotericism and Occultism as it provides a robust academic methodology for analyzing the historical evolution of magical texts. By meticulously demonstrating how ancient Mesopotamian incantations, akin to early 'grimoires' in their ritual function, were revised and expanded over time, Abusch illuminates the dynamic rather than static nature of magical traditions. The concept of 'Wiederaufnahme' as a redactional tool offers a valuable framework for discerning layers of textual development in other historical magical works. This challenges simplistic notions of an unchanging 'original' magical current and emphasizes the adaptive and accretive processes inherent in the transmission of magical knowledge, offering insights into how magical philosophies and practices themselves evolve through textual reinterpretation and expansion.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of academic researchers and students in Ancient Near Eastern studies, Assyriology, Religious Studies, and the History of Magic and Ritual. Scholars focused on textual criticism, redaction history, and the development of magical literature will find the detailed analysis particularly pertinent. Additionally, serious occult practitioners and scholars of Western Esotericism who are interested in the historical roots and textual evolution of magical practices, and who seek to understand the academic methods of source criticism applied to ancient grimoire-like traditions, would find this work valuable for its methodological rigor rather than for direct practical application."
