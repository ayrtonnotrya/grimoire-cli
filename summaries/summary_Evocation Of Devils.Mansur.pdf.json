  "central_thesis": "This grimoire provides practical instructions for various magical operations primarily aimed at summoning and compelling demonic entities ('бесы', 'пагубники'), restless spirits ('мертвые духи'), and nature spirits ('лесовик') to achieve specific material, interpersonal, or protective outcomes. The underlying philosophy dictates that these entities can be bound, placated, and directed through precise rituals, offerings, and powerful incantations that often subvert Christian symbolism and authority, drawing power from liminal spaces and forbidden acts.",

      "chapter_title": "Вызвать беса для исполнения просьбы",
      "summary": "A ritual involving collecting graveyard earth (from a crossroads and a nameless grave), splinters from three wooden crosses, and a black hen. Performed in a forest on an odd-numbered day, it requires drawing a cross with graveyard earth, building a bonfire of specific woods (including aspen) on its center, and burning the splinters while reciting an incantation that challenges Christian symbols to call a 'black demon'. The hen's head is sacrificed into the fire, its body held over the flames during another blood-binding incantation. Three handfuls of nameless grave earth are added to the fire, the chicken body is placed on the fire, and a final affirmation is made before leaving without looking back."

      "chapter_title": "Вызов беса на зеркало",
      "summary": "A ritual requiring a 9-day bloodless and physical fast, free from profanity. On the ninth day, a circle with the word 'НАРАН' and a cross is drawn on a black tablecloth. A mirror is placed vertically inside the circle, flanked by candles, with black bread and milk as offerings. After lighting candles, the practitioner stomps three times with the left foot and recites a long incantation calling a 'bes-pagubnik' to appear on the mirror's surface. Blood from a cut finger is used to draw a cross on the mirror, solidifying the binding. Consuming milk-dipped bread and a final incantation confirm the demon's acceptance. The mirror is hidden until the wish is granted, then cleansed and disposed of."

      "chapter_title": "Вызов беса на перекресток дорог",
      "summary": "Performed at a forest crossroads on a waning moon. A salt cross is drawn, an aspen peg driven into its center, and a bonfire built on top. Two more aspen pegs flank the fire. Standing at the cross, an incantation is recited twice, calling a 'bogohulnik' (blasphemer demon) through various worldly barriers to manifest in the fire. A chick is impaled on the central peg, its belly opened, and a blood-sacrifice incantation is spoken. The peg is then pulled, thrown into the fire with the chick and other pegs, with a final declaration for the task to be completed in 7 days. Malicious wishes involve using splinters from the pegs to harm a target, while beneficial wishes involve tying them to the recipient before discarding them at a crossroads. The ritual concludes by leaving without looking back."

      "chapter_title": "Вызов бесов на колоду карт",
      "summary": "Utilizes a used deck of playing cards. On any day except Saturday or Sunday, at dusk, near an Orthodox church, the practitioner shuffles the deck, places it on the ground, steps on it with their left foot, and circumambulates it three times counter-clockwise while reciting an incantation. This incantation binds the 36 'card demons' to serve the summoner through 'black words'. A 3-day fast (meatless, alcohol-free, celibate) is required only for the first performance. The consecrated deck must never be used for other purposes, serves for 9 years, and then must be burned. A re-binding can be done after 13 months."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Как заклясть самоубийцу",
      "summary": "On a Friday, following a 3-day meatless fast, the practitioner locates a suicide's grave. A mirror is placed face up on the grave. Chicks' legs are tied, their heads severed, and the headless bodies placed on the mirror. The practitioner circumambulates the grave 9 times counter-clockwise, reciting an incantation that addresses and binds the 'accursed soul' of the suicide through blood sacrifice and compels it into service. After the circumambulations, a final incantation seals the soul. To fulfill a request, the binding thread is burned in a forest. For harm, the thread is placed near an enemy's home or buried at their doorstep. For illness, the thread is soaked in water and used for washing."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Кровник (Вызвать беса на кровь)",
      "summary": "On a Friday, a chicken is sacrificed, its blood collected in a dish. A circle and cross are drawn with the blood on a white cloth spread on the ground. The chicken is placed on the cross, and the blood dish on the chicken. An incantation is recited 7 times, calling a 'bes-krovnik' (blood-oath demon) through blood-smeared gates and binding it. During 9 counter-clockwise circumambulations of the sacrifice, the practitioner loudly states their desire. Afterward, coins and crossroads dust are added to the blood. A final incantation is spoken thrice, declaring payment and the demon's task. A bonfire is made to burn the cloth and chicken, with accompanying incantations. The blood dish is placed on the embers, and a triple 'Amen' confirms the binding. A strict 9-day meatless fast follows."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Лесовика заклясть",
      "summary": "To bind a 'Lesovik' (forest spirit), the practitioner finds a large tree in a forest, leans against it, and recites an incantation. This incantation calls and binds the Lesovik for a day, comparing its power to a wolf's howl and its realm to an ancient forest. The ritual suggests observing its presence for nine nights through environmental signs. On the tenth day, the Lesovik is said to appear in misty or bright form. The incantation invokes 'black psalms' and non-Christian authority to compel the spirit to fulfill a stated request. The Lesovik is bound for nine days of service, then released for three. An offering of a boiled egg in its shell and three coins is left at the tree. This ritual must be performed during a waxing moon."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Пагубник (Призыв неупокоенных душ)",
      "summary": "This ritual is performed during a storm (wind, rain, thunder, snow). The practitioner cuts or pierces the middle finger of their left hand. Blood is used to draw a cross on the inner right palm and a dot on the inner wrist, then wiped with the left palm. Standing with feet apart and head bowed, a long incantation is recited. This calls 'cursed, bound, heavenly-rejected, shadowy' restless souls (pagubniki), appealing to their unfulfilled desires to serve. The practitioner asserts authority, stating their request. The ritual is said to derive from a 'black book of an apostate priest.' After recitation, the blood is licked from the left middle finger, and a final affirmation ('кровю зазвана...') is made. Hands are washed, right then left. If correctly performed, the request is fulfilled."

      "chapter_title": "Прислужник (Как беса на 13 лет в прислужники получить)",
      "summary": "A 13-day meatless fast, including celibacy and no alcohol, culminating on the full moon. On the 13th morning, an incantation is spoken, declaring mastery over dark deeds and binding a 'black demon' as a servant. That evening, a Christ icon is taken to a forest crossroads, placed face down on the ground, and stepped on with the left foot. A blasphemous incantation is recited, compelling the demon to serve for 13 years, fulfilling the practitioner's will. Thirteen nails are hammered into the icon, each representing a year of service, with an accompanying incantation. The icon is then buried in a pit. A live white chicken is cut over the pit and thrown in, with an incantation declaring payment for the 13 years. The pit is covered, and the practitioner leaves without looking back. The demon will assist for 13 years."

      "chapter_title": "Черное заклинание (Чтобы силы мертвых просьбу исполнили)",
      "summary": "On a waning moon and an odd-numbered day, at the grave of a married couple, a shallow dish is placed. A black chicken is sacrificed over it, allowing blood to drip into the dish. Once the bleeding stops, the practitioner sits on their right knee and immerses their left palm in the blood. A long incantation is recited, addressing the two deceased souls, binding them by blood and the practitioner's will to act as messengers and fulfill a request. The incantation emphasizes their power over the living and dead. After stating the request, the blood is smeared on the tombstone or cross with a specific declaration. The chicken's body, the dish, and the head are then buried or left on the grave. The practitioner leaves without looking back."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Чтобы покормить мертвых духов",
      "summary": "On any Wednesday, at a married couple's grave, a knife is stuck into the earth. An incantation is recited to 'break chains' and 'release' the spirits for 7 days, inviting them to a feast. Offerings of white bread, black bread, a boiled chicken egg, and two coins are placed on the grave. A long incantation calls 'krovniki, pogostniki, mertvetsy' to partake, binding them as protection and guardians. It also includes phrases suggesting the power to invert cosmic order. After the offerings, the practitioner cuts their right finger, drips blood onto the ground, and states that 'what is said is bound by strong oath.' The ritual concludes by leaving without looking back."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system presented is a collection of distinct, yet thematically interconnected, rituals designed to compel various entities (demons, restless human spirits, nature spirits) into the practitioner's service. Each ritual follows a structured methodology, emphasizing strict preparatory conditions (e.g., specific fasting, lunar phases), precise material components (e.g., graveyard soil, animal sacrifices, blood, consecrated objects like icons, candles, specific woods, coins), exact ritual actions (e.g., drawing symbols, physical gestures, specific circumambulations), and lengthy, often rhyming, alliterative, or blasphemous incantations. The primary binding mechanism relies on a combination of material offerings, the asserted authority of the magician (often by identifying as 'anathema' or 'master of black words'), and the deliberate desecration of Christian symbols. Successful execution is intended to yield wish fulfillment, protection, or the ability to inflict harm, while improper execution or failure is consistently implied to carry severe, unstated dangers.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This text serves as a significant primary document for understanding operative Slavic/Russian black magic within a grimoire tradition. It meticulously details the syncretic nature of this magic, blending pre-Christian folk beliefs (Lesovik, spirits of the dead) with post-Christian demonology ('Bes', blasphemy). The work illustrates a common grimoire pattern: the compelling of spirits through specific offerings, liminal locations (graveyards, crossroads, forests), and powerful, often repetitive and overtly blasphemous, incantations. It explicitly positions itself in opposition to mainstream Christian practice by actively desecrating its symbols and texts (icons, crosses, 'black psalms') to appropriate and wield power. The emphasis on practical, results-oriented magic for personal gain (love, wealth, revenge, protection) aligns with the utilitarian ethos typical of many traditional grimoires. The consistent use of animal sacrifice, particularly chickens and blood, underscores its deep roots in historical folk magical practices.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience for this text consists of advanced practitioners of traditional black magic, folk magic, and sorcery, as well as academic researchers interested in the historical and operative aspects of grimoire traditions, particularly within a Slavic cultural context. It is explicitly not intended for ethical or 'white' magic practitioners, nor for casual dabblers, given the strict requirements, inherent dangers, and the overtly malevolent or transgressive nature of many operations, such as curses, binding suicide ghosts, and desecration of religious symbols. The dense, ritualistic language and implicit cultural context require a practitioner with prior knowledge and commitment to the 'darker' path of occultism."
