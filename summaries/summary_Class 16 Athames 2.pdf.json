  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system described centers on the Athame as a focal point for the projection and manipulation of subtle energies, particularly specific color frequencies, to achieve practical magical results.

The system emphasizes direct energetic intervention to address psychic threats, unhealthy connections, and various physical ailments, often integrating a diagnostic step (e.g., checking how a person feels, observing color changes).",
