  "structure_content": [
    {
      "chapter_title": "Introduction to the Solomonic Cycle",
      "summary": "Discusses the difficulty in defining the 'Solomonic cycle' of magic, opting to include works bearing Solomon's name by tradition or artifice. Identifies two main classes: late antiquity/early Middle Ages magical works (e.g., The Testament of Solomon) and medieval grimoires (e.g., The Key of Solomon). Acknowledges Solomon's broader legend and the persistent rumors of his secret magical books."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "The Clavicles (Keys)",
      "summary": "Details two primary texts: The Key of Solomon and Lemegeton, or Lesser Key of Solomon. For The Key of Solomon, it highlights S.L. MacGregor Mathers' 'Key of Solomon the King' as the fullest presentation, along with treatments by Idries Shah and A.E. Waite. For Lemegeton, it describes its five sections: Goetia, Theurgia-Goetia, Pauline Art, Almadel, and Notary Art/Ars Nova. Discusses various editions of Goetia, including Mathers' and Crowley's, and mentions more complete editions of Lemegeton, notably Joseph H. Peterson's as the 'best edition available'."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "The Grimoires",
      "summary": "Covers three major grimoires: Grimorium Verum, True Black Magic, and The Grand Grimoire. For Grimorium Verum, it references Waite and Shah, and notes editions by Trident Press and I.G.O.S. True Black Magic is described with conflicting accounts, noting Butler's description of talismans and Waite's view as an adapted, confused version of the Key, often quoted for practical elements. The Grand Grimoire (Red Dragon) is discussed through Waite and Shah, mentioning limited editions and dual-language versions."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Honorius",
      "summary": "Emphasizes the crucial distinction between the older Sworn Book of Honorius (Liber Iuratus) and the later, diabolical Grimoire of Pope Honorius. References Butler, Waite, and Shah for treatments of the Grimoire. Discusses Kineta Ch'ien's limited edition of The Grimoire of Pope Honorius and Daniel Driscoll's translation of The Sworn Book, noting its incompleteness, and the I.G.O.S. edition of 'Grimoire of Honorius' which aligns with the Sworn Book."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Semiphoras and Shemhamphoras Salomonis Regis (S&S)",
      "summary": "Describes S&S as a compilation drawing from various magical traditions, often found bound with The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses. Notes its availability in editions from Egyptian Publishing Company, Wehman Brothers, and Migene Gonzolez-Wippler. Traces its historical roots to German collections by J.C. Horst and Scheibel, and notes its close textual parallels with Liber Salomonis."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Liber Salomonis, British Library Sloane MS 3826",
      "summary": "Provides a detailed account of Liber Salomonis, identifying it as folio pages 2r-57r of British Library Sloane MS 3826. Notes its self-identification as 'Cephar Raziel' and its narrative positioning of Solomon as the recipient rather than author. Outlines its seven treatises, covering astronomy, virtues of stones/herbs/beasts, suffumigations, timings for operations, abstinence, 'Samaim' (heavens and angels), and magical figures/ordinances. Also lists additional texts within Sloane MS 3826, including Incipit Canon, Orisons, Magical directions, Liber Lunae, and Raxhael."

      "summary": "Compiles a list of academic and occult literature that references British Library Sloane MS 3826. This includes works by Robert Mathiesen, M. Plessner, Idries Shah (Oriental Magic, The Secret Lore of Magic), Lynn Thorndike, and A.E. Waite (Book of Black Magic and of Pacts, The Book of Ceremonial Magic), highlighting its status as a significant source for the Sworn Book and Sefer Raziel."

This section includes influential texts like Agrippa's 'Of Occult Philosophy', Barrett's 'The Magus', Butler's 'Ritual Magic', and scholarly works on the history of magic."

      "chapter_title": "Addendum: Solomonic Magic on the Internet",
      "summary": "Offers a practical guide to online resources for Solomonic texts, categorized by the earlier sections (Clavicles, Grimoires, Honorius, S&S, Liber Salomonis). Highlights key websites like Twilit Grotto (www.esotericarchives.com), Sacred Texts Archive (www.sacred-texts.com), and Norton's Imperium (http://w3.one.net/~browe) for accessing texts, facsimiles, and transcriptions, often noting their origins from print sources."
