The deck's structure mirrors traditional tarot, with Major and Minor Arcana, allowing for standard readings.

These practical sections provide concrete rituals and visualizations that leverage the energy and symbolism of the cards and dragons to influence personal circumstances, foster spiritual growth, and enact magical change. The system posits that dragons are not just symbolic but are active conduits of potent spiritual and elemental energies that can be accessed and directed through focused intent and ritual.",

    "relevance": "The Celtic Dragon Tarot represents a modern synthesis of traditional Western esoteric practices (tarot, elemental correspondences, candle magic) with a popular, evocative archetype (dragons) and a specific cultural milieu (Celtic). Its relevance lies in its accessibility to both novice and experienced practitioners seeking a more dynamic and potent approach to divination and personal magic, particularly those drawn to dragon symbolism. It bridges the gap between academic interest in dragon lore and practical magical application.",

This includes tarot enthusiasts looking for new decks and interpretations, those interested in dragon-based spirituality, practitioners of witchcraft or spellwork seeking new tools, and individuals on a path of self-discovery and spiritual development who resonate with the themes of power, transformation, and ancient wisdom associated with dragons and Celtic traditions."
