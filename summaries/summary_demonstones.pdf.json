    "description": "The practical system detailed in 'Demon Stones' is a form of geomancy or lithomancy, specifically 'Demon Stone Divination'. Practitioners create a set of sixteen physical stones, each inscribed with a unique Demonic sigil. These stones undergo a rigorous consecration and empowerment ritual, imbuing them with the essence and power of the corresponding Demons. Once consecrated, the stones are used in various layouts or 'spreads' to answer questions or gain insight. The interpretation of each stone depends on its assigned Demonic attributes and its orientation (upright or reversed, indicated by a dot on the sigil). The system emphasizes a direct, personal connection with the invoked Demons as sources of divinatory knowledge.",
