  "central_thesis": "The paper argues for a significant correlation between the specific \"qybl\" formula in Jewish Aramaic magic bowls and a unique physical configuration where bowls were created and interred in bitumen-sealed pairs. This correlation is explored through the etymological punning inherent in \"qybl\" (purpose as counter-charm and physical form as \"opposite\" or \"meeting\"), suggesting a possible origin and transmission trail for this magical praxis.",

Etymologically, it also implies 'complaint,' 'battle,' 'darkness,' 'junction,' 'meeting,' and 'opposite,' referring to both the magical purpose and the physical configuration of paired bowls."

      "term": "Yaror (ירור)",

This form is often punningly linked to the 'qybl' formula, embodying concepts of 'junction' or 'opposite' to effect magical reversal."

While related to 'qybl' texts, 'hpykh' bowls do not always explicitly call themselves 'qybl' but share the core purpose of magical reversal."

    "description": "The 'qybl' system is a form of counter-magic employing inscribed earthenware bowls to avert and return malevolent magical actions (sorceries, curses, evil spirits/yarors) to their originators. The system leverages both specific textual formulae, often invoking angels and divine names, and a unique physical configuration where two bowls are bound rim-to-rim and sealed with bitumen, creating a unified magical object. This physical form is itself an embodiment of the 'qybl' concept, representing 'junction,' 'meeting,' and 'opposite' to trap and reflect the harmful magic.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant to Western Esotericism and Occultism as it delves into the operative mechanics and cultural context of ancient Near Eastern protective and aggressive magic. It illuminates the nuanced relationship between magical formulae and their physical containers, offering a unique perspective on how 'magic' was conceptualized and performed. The study of 'qybl' bowls, their specific formulas, and their physical arrangement (paired and sealed with bitumen) provides concrete archaeological and textual evidence for a sophisticated, pun-based magical system. It contributes significantly to understanding the transmission of magical traditions, specifically how practices evolve and are adopted across different formulae, impacting later grimoire traditions that often prescribe precise material and ritualistic components.",
