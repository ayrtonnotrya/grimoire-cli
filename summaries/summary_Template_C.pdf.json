      "chapter_title": "Stage 2: Sensory and Dimensional Data Collection",
      "summary": "This stage focuses on an exhaustive listing of sensory perceptions (textures, colors, smells, tastes, temperatures, sounds) and key spatial/temporal dimensions, along with an assessment of aesthetic impact and potential 'Analogs of Other Senses' (AOLs). The goal is to gather raw, unfiltered data before analytical overlay."

      "summary": "The final stage translates the collected Stage 2 dimensional data into a linear analytical sketch. This visual representation is then enhanced by integrating any spontaneous archetypal imagery or concepts that emerge during the process, providing deeper symbolic context to the perceived data."

      "term": "Spontaneous Archetypes",
      "definition": "Recurring universal symbols, patterns, or images (e.g., 'tree', 'hero', 'journey') that emerge intuitively during the viewing session and are deemed relevant to the target, to be incorporated into the final sketch for added depth."

    "relevance": "This protocol provides a highly structured framework for extrasensory perception, akin to controlled remote viewing methodologies. Its systematic breakdown of sensory input, dimensional data, and archetypal integration makes it highly relevant for practitioners seeking repeatable and verifiable results in consciousness exploration or information gathering. It emphasizes the crucial separation of raw psychic data from analytical overlay, which is a critical aspect of disciplined psychic work.",
