The operative side heavily emphasizes psychological work, astral projection, and dreaming as primary planes of interaction, aiming for the magician to become 'one' with the summoned force rather than merely commanding it.",

It offers a significant philosophical recontextualization of traditional Goetic magic, shifting the focus from hierarchical command and protection to internal self-development and the integration of 'demonic' forces as initiatory catalysts. The work bridges ancient grimoire traditions with modern self-transformation paradigms, emphasizing psychological and spiritual integration over external control. It is an important contribution to understanding Ford's specific interpretation and ongoing influence within the LHP.",

It is suitable for individuals with a strong foundation in occult philosophy, ceremonial magic, and a developed sense of personal Will. The text is not intended for beginners due to its advanced concepts, the emphasis on direct engagement and psychological integration of potentially 'dangerous' forces, and its explicit reinterpretation of traditional safety protocols, which could be misapplied by the unprepared."
