Kepple's view on reincarnation suggests co-existing incarnations."

      "chapter_title": "Interpretation of Inanna's descent myth",
      "summary": "Analyzes the Sumerian myth of Inanna's descent to the underworld as a spiritual journey of initiation. The myth is interpreted as Inanna seeking wisdom and understanding ('ear' and 'wisdom' being the same word in Sumerian) by willingly shedding her earthly powers and possessions. Each of the 'seven stages of descent' and the 'seven veils' corresponds to the removal of an attribute (crown, earrings, beads, breastplate, girdle, rod, garment) symbolizing the stripping of godhood, magic, illumination, emotions, ego, will, and sex role, linking them to the Kundalini chakras. This process represents facing one's dark side and achieving deep feminine wisdom."
