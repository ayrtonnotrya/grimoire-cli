      "definition": "Specific energy points or 'energy centers' within the astral body, often described as 'wheels' in Sanskrit, that are responsible for distributing vital energy throughout the system.

    {
      "term": "Grounding",
      "definition": "A fundamental practice for connecting with Earth energy and stabilizing one's own energy system. It involves visualizing a 'grounding cord' extending from the base of the spine into the center of the Earth, ensuring physical and psychic stability."

    {
      "term": "Running Energy",

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book outlines a structured, step-by-step practical system for developing psychic healing and reading abilities. It operates on the core principle that everyone is naturally psychic and can cultivate these skills through consistent practice. The system is largely internal, relying heavily on mental and energetic discipline rather than external magical tools. It progresses from foundational energy management (grounding, running energy) to basic healing and reading, then to more advanced techniques like working with spirit guides, past lives, and future projections. A key aspect is the constant interplay between awareness, intention, visualization, and the manipulation of subtle energy fields (auras and chakras). Ethical considerations, belief system analysis, and self-observation are integrated throughout the training.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book significantly contributes to Western Esotericism and Occultism by democratizing psychic practice, shifting it from an exclusive, mysterious domain to an accessible, learnable skill. Published in the late 1970s, it aligns with the burgeoning New Age movement's emphasis on self-empowerment and practical spirituality. Its 'how-to' approach, focusing on internal energy work (auras, chakras, grounding, visualization) rather than external tools or complex ceremonial magic, provides a foundational entry point for beginners in energy healing. It demystifies concepts like spirit guides and karma, integrating them into a practical framework. While it lacks the ceremonial rigor of Grimoire traditions or the intricate symbolic systems of Qabalah, its direct experiential methodology can be seen as a form of Chaos Magic 'gnosis' through repeated action, emphasizing belief and personal experience over dogmatic adherence. It directly addresses common psychological barriers to psychic development, which is a valuable addition to practical occult literature.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience is primarily individuals with little to no prior experience in psychic or occult practices, who are curious about developing their innate abilities. It appeals to those seeking practical, actionable steps for self-improvement, energy management, and alternative healing. Its clear, straightforward language and emphasis on natural, non-'spooky' abilities make it highly accessible to the general public interested in personal growth and subtle energy work, positioning it as a beginner's manual for contemporary energy healing and psychic self-help."
