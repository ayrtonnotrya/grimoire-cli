Its explicit mapping to the Qabalistic Four Worlds provides a structured framework for interpretation that links classical paganism with Hermetic Qabalah, offering a powerful tool for practitioners interested in a nuanced, layered understanding of the universe and self. The detailed descriptions for each card, including their practical applications, esoteric correspondences (e.g., Enochian Chessboard), and moral lessons, make it a rich resource for deep magical and divinatory work.",
