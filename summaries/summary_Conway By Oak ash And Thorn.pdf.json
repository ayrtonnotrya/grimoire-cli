    "relevance": "Conway's work is highly relevant in contemporary Western esotericism, addressing a growing desire for nature-based spiritual paths and personal empowerment. It demystifies shamanic practices, making them accessible for solitary practitioners who may not have access to traditional initiatory lineages. By focusing on personal responsibility and self-healing as foundational, it aligns with modern self-help and psychological integration trends, offering a practical framework for spiritual development rooted in Celtic lore. It provides a needed European-centric alternative to prevalent Native American or Siberian shamanic models.",
    "target_audience": "The book targets individuals interested in self-development, modern Paganism, Celtic mythology, and practical magic, particularly those seeking a solitary, accessible, and ethnically relevant approach to shamanism. It appeals to spiritual seekers who value personal experience, intuition, and direct connection with nature and 'Otherworld beings' over rigid dogma or traditional group structures. It's also suitable for those exploring alternative healing modalities and expanding their consciousness through meditative and astral practices."
