      "term": "Lenormand Cards",

    {
      "term": "Intuition",
      "definition": "The primary interpretive faculty emphasized, described as an inherent 'inner voice' that guides the practitioner in understanding card meanings and combinations, prioritized over strict logical 'ratio'."

    {
      "term": "Personality Card (PC)",
      "definition": "Card No. 28 (Man) or No. 29 (Woman), designated to represent the querent or their partner, pivotal for personal readings and defining relationships within a spread. Their position in a Grand Tableau (beginning = future focus, end = past focus) provides temporal context."

      "term": "Negative Cards",
      "definition": "A category of cards (e.g., Coffin No. 8, Rod No. 11, Birds No. 12, Rat No. 23, Scythe No. 10, Clouds No. 6, Paths No. 22) that typically signify challenges, illness, troubles, or undesirable situations, whose impact can be influenced by surrounding cards."
    },
    {
      "term": "Combinations",
      "definition": "The technique of interpreting two or more cards collectively to derive a more complex and nuanced meaning. The sequential 'order' of cards in a combination is critical, often altering the interpretation (e.g., Ring No. 25 + Scythe No. 10 indicates 'divorce', while Scythe No. 10 + Ring No. 25 indicates 'divorced')."

    {
      "term": "Grand Tableau (GT)",
      "definition": "A comprehensive divination spread utilizing all 36 Lenormand cards, typically arranged in a 4x8 grid with an additional row of four cards below, designed for detailed life readings across various domains (love, work, finance, etc.)."

    {
      "term": "Scythe (No. 10) Interpretations",
      "definition": "A card with position-dependent meanings: at the beginning of a line, it indicates a 'sudden start'; at the end of a line, a 'sudden end'; in the middle and to the right of a Personality Card, it suggests the querent should 'try harder' or is 'rather aggressive'."
    },
    {
      "term": "Clouds (No. 6) Interpretations",
      "definition": "A card indicating 'unclarity' or 'obscurity'. When it appears at the end of a line of interpretation, it specifically signifies that the issue or problem 'will pass'."
    },
    {
      "term": "Book (No. 26) Interpretations",
      "definition": "A card signifying 'knowledge', 'secret', or 'something not yet definite'. When preceding another card in a combination, it means the subsequent event or situation is 'not yet definite' or 'cannot be clearly defined yet'."

      "term": "Key (No. 33) Combinations",
      "definition": "A card representing 'power', 'labour', 'crafts', or 'activity'. In specific combinations, such as with Heart (No. 24) or Lilly (No. 30), it denotes 'taking action' (e.g., 'the action of love and lovemaking')."

    {
      "term": "Covering the Grand Tableau",
      "definition": "An advanced technique for deep inquiry into a specific topic. Seven predetermined cards are removed from the main Grand Tableau spread (typically every fifth card), shuffled separately, and then strategically placed to cover existing cards of particular interest, with the resulting two-card overlays interpreted for further detail."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system is a progressive, intuition-focused approach to Lenormand cartomancy. It begins with memorizing the 36 individual card meanings, then advances to interpreting two- and three-card combinations, understanding card context around a 'Personality Card' (cross spread), and finally, performing a full 36-card Grand Tableau. The method stresses daily practice and trusting one's inner voice, gradually building interpretive confidence and skill for both personal insights and readings for others.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant as a foundational Lenormand cartomancy manual, systematically introducing core concepts and progressive interpretive methods. Its emphasis on personal intuition and a non-dogmatic approach resonates with contemporary esoteric practices that value subjective experience in divination. The inclusion of ethical guidelines for reading for others is a significant and often crucial aspect that enhances its practical relevance.",
    "target_audience": "The clear target audience for this 'Basic Course' is novices to Lenormand cards or cartomancy. The step-by-step instructions, numerous exercises, and a philosophy that encourages self-discovery make it ideal for self-learners. While it briefly touches on the subconscious, its detailed focus remains on the mechanics of Lenormand reading, making it suitable for those specifically interested in this divinatory art rather than broader magical systems."
