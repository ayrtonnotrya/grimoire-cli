It details both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications (rituals) for achieving personal mastery and influencing reality through Greater and Lesser Magic, all within a naturalistic framework. The text also serves as a polemic against societal mediocrity and traditional Abrahamic religions, asserting Satanism as a path for the 'Carnal type' in a 'Sinfonia Diabolica' of life.",

The text is specifically crafted for 'Carnal types' who embrace their natural self and reject 'Ethereal' (self-hating) worldviews, emphasizing personal mastery and the pursuit of joy."
