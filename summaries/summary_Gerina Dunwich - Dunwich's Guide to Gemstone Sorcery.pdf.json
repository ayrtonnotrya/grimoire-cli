  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system presented in 'Dunwich's Guide to Gemstone Sorcery' is a form of operative gemstone magic, emphasizing the practitioner's active engagement with the inherent energies of stones. The foundational premise is that stones possess 'receptive' (female) or 'projective' (male) energies, which can be influenced by planetary, astrological, and elemental forces. The practitioner's 'will and intent' are paramount in directing these energies, with 'visualization' and 'energy-raising techniques' being crucial for effective spellcasting. The system is structured around preparatory steps (cleansing and charging stones) and the precise application of specific gemstones for various magical outcomes. Timing, often aligned with lunar phases or planetary hours, is a key consideration for maximizing efficacy. The book provides a diverse array of rituals and spells, from simple charms to more complex altars and divinatory practices, demonstrating how stones can be integrated into nearly every aspect of magical work.",
