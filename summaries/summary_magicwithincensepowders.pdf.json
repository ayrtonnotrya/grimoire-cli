  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system outlined by Anna Riva hinges on the sympathetic and energetic properties attributed to various incenses and powders. Rituals are meticulously detailed, involving specific preparations, timing, and components. The core mechanic is the focused application of a named incense or powder (often combined with oils, herbs, or talismans) to a target (person, object, location) while verbally reinforcing the intention through chants or prayers. The 'faith power' of the practitioner is consistently emphasized as the driving force behind successful manifestation, creating a magical feedback loop where belief empowers the material agents.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "Anna Riva's 'Magic with Incense and Powders' is highly relevant within folk magic and occult traditions, serving as a comprehensive grimoire for operative magic. It democratizes magical practice by providing accessible, step-by-step rituals for a wide array of common human problems and desires, blending elements from Hoodoo, planetary magic, ceremonial magic (e.g., using Seals from the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses), and devotional practices (e.g., invoking saints, using Psalms). Its emphasis on the practitioner's 'faith power' aligns with fundamental principles found across many magical systems, making it a foundational text for those seeking practical, results-oriented spellcraft.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of practitioners of folk magic, Hoodoo, and practical occultists, ranging from beginners to those with some experience. The clear, direct instructions and categorization by intent make it highly suitable for individuals seeking immediate, tangible results in areas such as love, money, protection, healing, and control. It also appeals to those interested in the 'operative' side of magic rather than purely theoretical or philosophical study, as well as individuals who appreciate the syncretic blend of diverse magical traditions."
