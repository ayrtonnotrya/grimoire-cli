  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system presented is a practical, herb-based magic system rooted in folk traditions, designed for tangible results in areas such as love, protection, and success. It operates on the principle that herbs, oils, and incenses are 'keystones' that, when properly chosen, prepared, and applied in rituals, generate specific energies or 'vibrations' to manifest desires. The system emphasizes precision through botanical names, proper storage, and careful selection based on a herb's primary and secondary magical attributions (e.g., commanding, compelling, uncrossing, aphrodisiac, protective, luck-inducing). Rituals often involve anointing items, creating charm bags, burning incenses, preparing magical baths or floorwashes, and utilizing 'catalyst' or 'twister' herbs. A strong ethical component is present, with strict warnings against 'Black Magick' applications, especially in love. The concept of 'psychic herbs' affecting the mind and intuition also features prominently.",
