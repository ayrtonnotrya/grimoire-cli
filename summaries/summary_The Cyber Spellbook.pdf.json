  "central_thesis": "The book posits that traditional magical practices must evolve with society and technology, arguing that Cyber Magick bridges historical witchcraft and the modern, technologically-driven world. It advocates for the integration of technological items and virtual concepts as potent tools and symbols for spellcasting, ritual, and spiritual growth, thereby normalizing and making magick accessible within daily life and digital interfaces. The core premise is that technology holds metaphysical potential ripe for magical application.",
