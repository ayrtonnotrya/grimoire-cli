It serves as a key primary source for studying the Church of Satan and its founder, contextualizing its emergence within Western esotericism and counter-cultural movements of the 20th century. The analysis of Lesser and Greater Magic offers a psychological and performative approach to magic, moving beyond the purely symbolic to describe operative techniques for achieving real-world results.",
