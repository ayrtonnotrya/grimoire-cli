      "summary": "Introduces the Order of the Sepulcher of the Obsidian Masque (OSOM) and its core function of psychodramatic ritual theatre. It announces the upcoming 'Masques of Initiation' for the Set-XIII Conclave, encouraging Setian participation.

Its mission is to uphold initiatory excellence while forging new traditions relevant to Temple of Set philosophy, fostering a magical and intellectual environment conducive to members' progress. The Phoenix imagery symbolizes Xeper and Remanifestation, with Priest Don Webb and Adept Arnold Watson leading."

      "chapter_title": "Book Review: Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition",
      "summary": "Reviews Ed Regis's book, highlighting its relevance to Setians. The book chronicles scientists pursuing a 'transhuman future' through cryonics, immortalism, and nanotechnology. It aligns these scientific endeavors with Setian concepts like the 'Serpent of Eden' and the 'Great Work of the Mad Scientist', viewing the transhuman condition as a welcomed path for Black Magicians seeking to transcend human limitations."

      "chapter_title": "Editorial Arena (Power or Immortality?)",
      "summary": "This section debates whether 'power' or 'immortality' is more important for Setians. Contributors like Don Webb III° argue power is a tool for immortality and self-creation, cautioning against its misuse. Nancy Kleinman IV° states their interdependency ('Power without immortality is finite; immortality without power is Hell'). James Lewis VI° sees both as integral, emphasizing power as ability and immortality as a quality of the soul, linked to present awareness and 'Ageless Intelligence', accentuating the 'totality of the soul' and Xeper."

      "chapter_title": "Religion and the Self: A Letter",
      "summary": "Pat Hardy III° discusses the 'religious impulse' in the Temple of Set. While acknowledging that conventional religion can be regressive, he asserts that Setian 'religious trappings' function as psychodramatic tools to expose and dismantle restrictive beliefs, enabling the individual to experience the 'numinous' as the true source of self-value and meaning. This process allows the psyche's divinity to become real, distinguishing Setian practice from uncritical belief systems."

      "summary": "A practical guide by Dennis Mann III° offering legal advice for Setians facing police encounters, emphasizing Constitutional rights, the necessity of legal counsel (preferably on retainer), and the Temple's strict policy against drug use. It advises silence, politeness, documenting incidents, and immediately contacting legal representation or an Elect member, highlighting self-protection within potentially hostile societal contexts."

Knowles I° expressing profound sorrow and anger ('Dæmon weeps') over various societal injustices and human sufferings, from prenatal addiction and hunger to war and disease. It concludes with a defiant declaration of wrath and the Dæmon's enigmatic smile, suggesting a powerful, transformative response to these grievances."

      "summary": "A poetic invocation by Ronnie Guy Smith I° celebrating the 'dawn of Darkness' and the internal 'Black Flame' as sources of divine power, linked to the 'Essence of Hell' and 'Sun of the Night'. It describes joining the Black Flame, invoking Set, and treading a 'forbidden Path' driven by vengeance and commitment to the 'Darkness of the Flame' for personal transformation."

      "summary": "Vesa Iitti I° details a 'threshold' ritual performed with Adept Laakso, aimed at achieving greater consciousness. The ritual involves shamanic drumming, lighting the Black Flame, and invoking Set as 'Prince of Darkness' and 'Being of Essence non-natural'. It proceeds with summoning elemental forces, interacting with Beelzebub (receiving the Grail of restlessness/invention), Belial (receiving the Pentagram of Set for perfect freedom), and Satan (receiving the Mark of the Beast for Xeper), culminating in the extinguishment of the Black Flame and affirmation of completion."

      "chapter_title": "The Black Meditation",
      "summary": "James B. Severson II° defines Black Meditation as an LHP practice for self-refinement and direct interaction with the 'Gift of Set' (Black Flame). It involves communication, contemplation, reflection, focus, thought, and projection, all centered on conscious will. It aims to establish a silent state of awareness, allowing the Initiate to commune from altered states of consciousness to enhance will. Unlike RHP meditation, it’s not for universal union but for individual expansion, with each meditation having a specific purpose ('Black Tower') and emphasizing conscious control over thought processes."

This is presented as a matter of respect and not snobbery, critical for maintaining effective internal communication and decorum."

      "chapter_title": "My Last Three Books",
      "summary": "Michael A. Aquino VI° selects three books for a desert island scenario, representing Setian philosophical principles. Jules Verne's 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea' symbolizes the soul's rejection of nature and becoming a supernatural god. Bram Stoker's 'The Jewel of Seven Stars' illuminates true immortality as the 'infinite radiance of one's soul' beyond physical existence or reincarnation. Arnold Federbush's 'The Man Who Lived in Inner Space' depicts regression to pre-human existence, illustrating the body's return to nature while the ka (soul) remains distinct. He briefly mentions Robert W. Chambers’ 'The King in Yellow' as a fourth, unelaborated choice."

      "chapter_title": "Glinda Goes to the Dogs (Maybe)",
      "summary": "Explores the potential linkage of Glinda (Setian e-mail) to FidoNet, an international e-mail network. Pros include local access without long-distance charges, while cons involve privacy concerns due to multiple 'electronic hands' and limited access to Glinda's features. It acknowledges FidoNet's 'notorious reputation' and stresses the need for stringent procedures to maintain the exclusivity and integrity of Setian electronic traffic."

It contextualizes Setian thought within broader occult, esoteric, and even scientific (transhumanism) discourse, demonstrating the dynamic and evolving nature of its philosophy. Furthermore, the practical advice on legal matters and internal protocol underscores the pragmatic and self-preservative aspects vital for practitioners of a marginalized spiritual path.",

The content assumes a baseline familiarity with Setian terminology and Left Hand Path principles, aiming to deepen understanding, stimulate personal magical work, and foster community engagement and responsibility among its members."
