It provides an accessible entry point into the complex cosmological and psycho-spiritual model of creation, emanation, and rectification that is central to modern Qabalistic and Hermetic traditions. The emphasis on symbolic interpretation prevents literalist pitfalls common in occult appropriations, making it relevant for practitioners seeking a nuanced understanding of cosmic mechanics and their operative implications.",

It is particularly aimed at those seeking to understand the underlying mechanics of ritual and meditation from an 'orthodox' or 'Kosher' perspective, distinguishing it from non-traditional interpretations. The inclusion of controversial topics like UFOs and Aliens also suggests an audience open to bridging traditional Kabbalah with modern speculative interests, while still grounding it in established thought."
