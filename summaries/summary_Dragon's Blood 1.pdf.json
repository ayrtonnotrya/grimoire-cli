It offers a unique synthesis of ancient Mesopotamian, Egyptian, and Hebrew mythologies with modern occult interpretations drawn from Lovecraft and the Necronomicon. The blend of theoretical background with explicit practical rituals provides a clear framework for operative magic, positioning the work as a foundational text for those engaging with chthonic and abyssal forces for self-transformation.",

Additionally, it appeals to independent practitioners of the Left Hand Path, Chaos Magic, and those exploring Lovecraftian magic or Necronomicon-based occultism. The content assumes a degree of familiarity with esoteric concepts and a willingness to engage with 'darker' or traditionally transgressive spiritual paths aimed at profound individual magical development and self-deification."
