Extensive prayers and powerful invocations employ a multitude of divine names (e.g., Adonay, Tetragrammaton, Sabaoth) to command and bind planetary spirits, particularly focusing on the Jupiterian spirits and their messenger, Turiel. The section culminates in the exact dialogue for interrogating the evoked spirit, granting a license to depart, and formalizing a 'Bond of Spirits' to ensure future compliance, and provides the unique sigil for Turiel."

    "description": "The system described is a comprehensive framework for ceremonial planetary magic, focused on the evocation of spirits for various purposes. It mandates a stringent preparatory phase for the operator, including seven days of physical and spiritual purification. Key to the operation is the precise timing of rituals according to planetary hours, the construction and consecration of specific magical tools and talismans (pentacles/lamens), and the use of corresponding planetary perfumes. The core process involves invoking divine names to establish authority, conjuring the desired planetary spirit (e.g., Turiel, a Messenger of Jupiter), and engaging in a structured dialogue to extract information or commands, culminating in a binding oath and formal dismissal.",

It is suggested that the white of a new-laid egg would prove an effective substitute, having a similar life potential, and being equally suitable as a cohesive medium.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "The Secret Grimoire of Turiel is highly relevant as a practical manual within the Solomonic and broader grimoire tradition, demonstrating a Christianized Kabbalistic approach to spirit evocation. It provides a structured, step-by-step system for engaging with planetary intelligences, emphasizing preparation, divine authority, and the utility of spirits. Its inclusion of editorial notes on controversial practices like blood sacrifice reflects an adaptation to modern occult ethics while preserving historical text, bridging ancient practice with contemporary concerns.",
