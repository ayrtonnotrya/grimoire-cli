Magick is treated as a skill for aligning one's will with natural laws to achieve goals, rather than invoking supernatural forces. The system encourages practitioners to develop a personal Book of Shadows, master basic energetic practices, and structure rituals in a defined sequence, all while emphasizing freedom in personal practice over rigid adherence to a single tradition.",
