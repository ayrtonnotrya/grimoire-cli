This is a foundational practice for all card types.",
      "**Synthetic Interpretation:** Combine numerological meanings (numbers 1-10 and their universal themes), elemental suit meanings (Air, Fire, Water, Earth), and archetypal understandings (Major Arcana, Court Cards) to form a holistic and personalized interpretation of each card.",
      "**Spread Work & Pattern Recognition:** Utilize various card spreads (e.g., Celtic Cross, relationship spreads, custom spreads) as frameworks for interpreting messages. Understand how cards interact within positions and identify underlying patterns and narratives within the layout.",
