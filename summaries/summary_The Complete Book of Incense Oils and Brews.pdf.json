  "practical_system": {
    "description": "Cunningham's practical system is a form of 'natural magic' centered on harnessing the inherent magical energies of natural substances, primarily herbs, resins, and oils. The core mechanism involves identifying specific magical goals (e.g., love, protection, money, healing), selecting ingredients whose established magical correspondences align with that goal, and then preparing these ingredients into various forms: incenses (for atmospheric influence), oils (for anointing), brews (for ingestion or cleansing), ointments (for topical application), sachets (for carrying), and powders (for sprinkling). The crucial step is 'empowerment,' where the practitioner's focused will and visualization are channeled into the preparation, imbuing it with directed magical energy. The system is designed to be accessible, intuitive, and adaptable, requiring minimal external ritualistic pomp and instead relying on the practitioner's internal power and connection to nature.",

Its straightforward language and practical focus also appeal to individuals seeking to create their own magical tools and preparations using common, natural ingredients."
