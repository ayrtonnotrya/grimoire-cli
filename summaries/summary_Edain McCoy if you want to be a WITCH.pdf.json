McCoy's emphasis on personal study ('year and a day') and the diligent development of core magical skills sets a realistic expectation for new practitioners, moving beyond instant gratification often associated with popular occult narratives. It differentiates between various Pagan traditions and provides practical steps for solitary practitioners, acknowledging the diverse landscape of contemporary Witchcraft.",

It caters to those who prefer a structured learning approach to magical and ritual work, rather than purely theoretical or highly dogmatic texts."
