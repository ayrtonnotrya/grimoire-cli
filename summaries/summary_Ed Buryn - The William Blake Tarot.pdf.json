    "description": "The system utilizes a 79-card deck, comprising 23 'Triumphs' (Major Arcana equivalents) that map to Blake's 'Soul's Journey' and 56 'Creative Process Suits' (Minor Arcana equivalents) representing Blake's four primal expressions of imagination: Painting, Science, Music, and Poetry.

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This work stands as a significant contribution to modern Western Esotericism by recontextualizing the Tarot through the unique philosophical and mythological lens of William Blake. It deviates from traditional occult interpretations by renaming 'Major Arcana' to 'Triumphs' and 'Minor Arcana' to 'Creative Process Suits,' explicitly rejecting the concept of 'secrets' (arcana) in favor of accessibility and openness. This aligns with modern magical currents that prioritize personal experience and creativity over dogma and hierarchical structures. By integrating Blake's Zoas and their associated elements with the Tarot, it provides a profound psychological and spiritual framework for understanding human consciousness and its journey towards regeneration, offering a robust system for self-analysis and creative problem-solving distinct from purely predictive or ritualistic approaches. Its emphasis on Imagination as a divine, central force resonates with contemporary magical paradigms that empower the individual as a co-creator of reality.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes individuals seeking practical and inspirational tools for personal creativity and spiritual growth, particularly those interested in self-understanding and problem-solving through an artistic and psychological framework. It strongly appeals to students and practitioners of Western Esotericism and Occultism who value intellectual depth, appreciate William Blake's art and philosophy, and are open to alternative, non-dogmatic interpretations of Tarot. The deck is also suitable for those looking to move beyond conventional Tarot's 'secrets' and explore a system emphasizing personal revelation, ethical responsibility, and the cultivation of imaginative faculties."
