    "relevance": "The Scroll of Set, Issue 77, provides relevant insights into Setian philosophy and practical magic, particularly highlighting the often-underestimated role of self-presentation and public perception in magical work. It effectively bridges 'Greater Magic' (internal transformation) and 'Lesser Magic' (external influence), demonstrating their intertwined nature. The discussions on Xeper offer foundational guidance for initiates, while the inclusion of numerological analysis and article reviews showcases a broader occult interest and a practical approach to extracting magical relevance from diverse sources. This issue underscores the Temple of Set's focus on individual becoming and effective engagement with the mundane world.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of Initiates and practitioners of Setianism, Western Esotericism, and Occultism. It is particularly valuable for those within the Temple of Set due to its internal references and guidance on Xeper. More broadly, it appeals to practitioners of ceremonial or practical magic seeking to enhance their influence, deepen their understanding of magical dynamics, and apply occult principles to both personal transformation and external worldly interactions."
