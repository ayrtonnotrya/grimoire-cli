      "term": "Planetary Correspondence",
      "definition": "The system associates specific pentacles, spirits, colors, and magical virtues with each of the seven traditional planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon).

    }
  ],
  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system outlined in 'The Key of Solomon' is a comprehensive ceremonial magic manual for creating and activating seventy-seven planetary pentacles. The magic operates by leveraging the inherent virtues of the seven traditional planets, channeled through the precise inscription of divine names, angelic intelligences, scriptural versicles, and mystical characters onto physical talismans (pentacles). The practitioner uses these consecrated pentacles as instruments of command to invoke, bind, and compel spirits—both angelic and demonic—to manifest desired outcomes, ranging from material acquisition and protection to spiritual knowledge and the manipulation of natural phenomena. The efficacy of the operation is contingent on the correct construction, consecration, and ritual application of the pentacle.",

Specific pentacles require unique inks or blood (e.g., screech-owl blood, bat blood).",
      "Invocation and Command: Utilizes the completed pentacle within a magical circle. The pentacle is shown to spirits, acting as a visual and symbolic mandate for obedience. Divine and angelic names inscribed on the pentacle are recited as powerful compelling forces.",

      "Consecration: Though not explicitly detailed as a separate ritual on these pages, the act of precise creation on specific days/hours, combined with the use of sacred names and versicles, implies a process of charging and sanctifying the pentacle for its intended purpose."

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "The Key of Solomon is a foundational grimoire within Western Esotericism, serving as a primary source for ceremonial magic traditions. It systematically codifies planetary magic, demonology, and angelology, influencing countless subsequent magical orders and practitioners. Its detailed instructions on creating and employing pentacles, along with its reliance on Hebrew mystical elements and biblical texts, establish a distinctive Judeo-Christian magical framework. The work's enduring relevance lies in its practical operative instructions for communicating with and commanding spiritual entities to achieve specific mundane and spiritual aims.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience consists primarily of practicing ceremonial magicians, occultists, and scholars of Western Esotericism and the grimoire tradition. Practitioners require a working knowledge of ritual magic, Qabalah, and Hebrew to fully engage with and implement the system. Scholars find it invaluable for understanding the historical development and practical mechanics of Solomonic magic."
