He contrasts the ToS's 'horizon' with the 'collapsed' horizon of the Church of Satan, emphasizing individual responsibility for rational and supra-rational initiation.

For practitioners, it reinforces the path of individual evolution and the organizational structure. For academics studying Western Esotericism and new religious movements, it offers direct insight into the internal dialogue, governance, and self-definition of a significant Left Hand Path order.",
