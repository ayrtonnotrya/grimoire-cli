It operates on principles of sympathetic magic, numerology, and the inherent power of sacred names and texts.",

      "text": "To understand a people—and through it, humankind—is to see its whole life. This has been a peculiarly difficult task where Jews are concerned, for the vision of the world has been obscured by darkly bias-tinted spectacles. If, on the one hand, Christo logical and anti-Semitic prejudices have revealed only an infamous horde of blasphemers and parasites, on the other, a historical perspec tive limited by Scripture has disclosed an exalted band of prophets, hounded and persecuted as prophets must be for their vision and temerity. Between these two extremes—which have alike doomed Jews to the unhappiest of careers—a normal people, with all the faults and virtues of humanity, has pursued its normal course through history, however abnormal were the conditions against which it struggled.",

Their opposition was not to magic generally, but to this particular “idolatrous” form; the use of angels, names, and even demons, involving an appeal to the supernatural and a recognition of the supremacy of God, was admitted past the barrier on sufferance, but the more frequently it was frowned upon, the more it was tolerated.",

The ritual murder accusation was the result of these beliefs.",

Its detailed historical context and rich source material make it suitable for advanced students and seasoned researchers alike."
