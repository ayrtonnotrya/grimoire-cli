The diverse articles showcase how core Setian tenets are integrated into a range of magical practices, from introspective childhood work to energy manipulation and ritual incense use. It demonstrates the active, experimental nature of Setianism, contrasting it with other traditions (e.g., Gurdjieff) while solidifying its distinct identity.",

Secondarily, it appeals to academic researchers and advanced practitioners of Western Esotericism, Occultism, and Left-Hand Path traditions seeking in-depth insights into the operative and philosophical aspects of the Temple of Set's magical system."
