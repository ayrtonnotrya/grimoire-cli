  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The 'practical system' described is less a set of discrete rituals and more a philosophical framework for understanding and interacting with one's own Corporeal Intelligence and physical vehicle. The core practice involves recognizing the body as a divinely organized entity and a manifestation of spirit. The key operative is to approach the physical body and its processes (like sleep) with love, acceptance, and conscious instruction, working in harmony with the subconscious processes that maintain it. The emphasis is on elevating the physical to a 'Temple of the living God' and refining it as a vehicle for higher consciousness.",
