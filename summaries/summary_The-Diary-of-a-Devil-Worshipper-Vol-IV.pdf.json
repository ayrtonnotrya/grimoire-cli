Since the most of the black magickians have some excess of energy they often create the impression of being arrogantly extravagant - especially during their youth.One of the great paradoxes is the compatibility between the black magickians` indulgence in life and their quest of energetic wholeness.]",

Of course, they should be first excited to ecstatic trance beforehand (by dance, intoxication or torture). The result of such a sacrifice would be two whole Satanic beings born on acausal level (each one united with his/her Animus/Anima at the moment of death) and a third one, who would be an acausal manifestation of Satan on the causal level - thus opening/creating a tremendous nexion.]",

    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant to contemporary LHP discourse, offering a raw, unfiltered perspective on radical occult philosophy and practice. It critically engages with and diverges from established ONA tenets while introducing unique concepts such as 'Terrotic Drawings,' 'Magickal Socialism,' and a distinct theory of Aeonic change. Its exploration of personal psychological struggles within a magical quest, alongside controversial topics like human sacrifice and racialist ideologies, makes it a potent and confrontational text for those examining the extremes of Western Esotericism.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of experienced practitioners and academics specializing in the Left Hand Path, particularly those familiar with or critically engaged in the Order of Nine Angles, Tempel ov Blood, and similar radical occult traditions. Its dense philosophical and technical language, coupled with explicit discussions of transgressive practices and challenging personal experiences, makes it unsuitable for beginners or those seeking light reading in mainstream esotericism."
