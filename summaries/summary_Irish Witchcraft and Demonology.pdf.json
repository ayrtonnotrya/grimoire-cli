  "central_thesis": "The book aims to be the first comprehensive collection of scattered stories and records of witchcraft in Ireland, arguing that belief in witchcraft did take a fairly firm hold there, though perhaps more muted than elsewhere in Europe, and tracing its historical progression and specific manifestations, particularly among the Anglo-Norman/Protestant population, while also discussing related supernatural phenomena.",

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER I: SOME REMARKS ON WITCHCRAFT IN IRELAND",
      "summary": "This chapter introduces the book's premise, challenging the notion that Ireland was exempt from witchcraft. It explores reasons for Ireland's perceived lesser involvement, such as geographical aloofness, the influence of Anglo-Norman invaders, the distinct nature of Celtic beliefs versus Anglo-Norman views on witchcraft (as an offense against God and man), the impact of the Reformation, and a noted absence of witchcraft literature in Ireland. It argues that while less prevalent, witchcraft did exist and was taken seriously, particularly by the Protestant minority, but the turmoil of the period prevented it from maturing as elsewhere. It also highlights the less severe methods of torture and execution compared to the Continent and Scotland, mainly focusing on historical records from Anglo-Norman and Protestant communities."

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER II: DAME ALICE KYTELER, THE SORCERESS OF KILKENNY (A.D. 1324)",
      "summary": "This chapter provides a detailed account of the Kyteler case, the first well-documented witchcraft trial in Ireland. Dame Alice Kyteler, from an Anglo-Norman family, was accused in 1324 by her four husbands' children of denying the Christian faith, sacrificing dismembered animals to a demon named Son of Art, seeking demonic counsel, blasphemously imitating excommunication rituals, and using powders and ointments (made from gruesome ingredients) to cause love, hatred, disease, or death. She was also accused of having carnal knowledge with the incubus Son of Art. Despite attempts by powerful figures like Chancellor Roger Outlawe and Seneschal Sir Arnold le Poer to obstruct Bishop Richard de Ledrede's prosecution, Kyteler fled to England. Her accomplice, Petronilla of Meath, confessed under torture and was publicly burned alive in Kilkenny on November 3, 1324, marking the first instance of death by fire for heresy in Ireland. The chapter also details the subsequent persecution of Kyteler's associates and Bishop de Ledrede's eventual downfall and exile."

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER III: A.D. 1223-1583",
      "summary": "This chapter contextualizes the Kyteler case, asserting its uniqueness in early Irish witchcraft records. It notes prior mentions of heresy and unorthodoxy in the Diocese of Ossory around 1317. The chapter discusses other instances of heresy, such as the burning of Adam Dubh in 1327 and two men in Bunratty in 1353, linking them to a wider wave of heresy manifesting as denial of Church doctrine and magical arts. It then touches on historical figures associated with magical powers, like Michael Scot (Archbishop-elect of Cashel, renowned necromancer) and Gerald, fourth Earl of Desmond (the Poet). The chapter also includes an account of an Irish prophetess who foretold King James I of Scotland's assassination in 1437. A sorcery accusation in the 1447 Parliament Rolls suggests earlier, unrecorded instances. It mentions a 1544 inquiry into a witch and a 1578 Kilkenny trial where two witches and a 'blackamoor' were executed. Finally, it details the 1586 Irish Statute against witchcraft, which provided for the death penalty for fatal bewitchment and lesser penalties for non-fatal practices, noting its relative mildness compared to European laws. It also describes the superstition of 'eye-biting witches' harming cattle and the legend of the Enchanted Earl of Desmond."

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER IV: A.D. 1606-1656",
      "summary": "This chapter documents various magical and supernatural events in Ireland during the early to mid-17th century. It begins with the 1606 trial of John Aston, a clergyman accused of using invocations and conjurations of 'wicked and lying spirits' to find stolen silver and gold and to ascertain the whereabouts of Hugh, Earl of Tyrone. It describes a 1609 case where magical spells were counteracted by a holy relic at Holy Cross Abbey, leading Anastasia Sobechan to vomit pins and cloth. The chapter features the tale of Dr. Alexander Colville, a Doctor of Divinity accused of selling his soul to the Devil for wealth, whom he outsmarted by using a hat with a slit over a kiln-pit to accumulate gold and later extinguishing a candle to delay his due. It also includes an account of John Stewart, who gained knowledge from the King of Fairies, and Reverend Robert Blair's encounter with a man supposedly possessed by a Devil. Strange apparitions in Co. Tipperary (1678) and Portadown (of murdered people) are recounted, along with instances of charmed lives and prophecies by Archbishop James Usher. The chapter concludes with the story of Mr. John Browne and a mysteriously opening locked chest, hinting at a premonition of death."

      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER V: FLORENCE NEWTON, THE WITCH OF YOUGHAL (A.D. 1661)",
      "summary": "This chapter presents a detailed account of the 1661 trial of Florence Newton, the 'Witch of Youghal.' Newton was accused of bewitching Mary Longdon and causing the death of David Jones. Longdon testified that Newton's kiss led to violent fits, vomiting needles, pins, and other objects, and being invisibly moved around the house. Newton was also observed to cause Longdon's fits to intensify when brought near her and to spontaneously fall when Newton made certain gestures. During her trial, Newton was tested for her ability to recite the Lord's Prayer (which she struggled with) and had her body probed for insensitive spots. David Jones's widow testified that Newton's kiss through prison grates caused Jones to suffer severe pain and eventually die. The chapter describes the 'water-experiment' contemplated by the Mayor of Youghal for witches. Noteworthy individuals like Valentine Greatrakes (a famous healer) were involved in the proceedings. The author notes the historical value of the account, based on Judge Sir William Aston's notes, as an eye-witness record of a witch-trial in mid-17th century Ireland."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER VI: A.D. 1662-1686",
      "summary": "This chapter continues to document diverse supernatural events and magical beliefs. It recounts a humorous tale of Joseph Damer, who outsmarted the Devil in a bargain for gold by using a boot with a removed sole over a hole, leading the Devil to fill a cellar. Another story from Ballinagarde describes Mr. Croker's encounter with the Devil, identified by a cloven hoof. A prominent account details a ghost (James Haddock) who appeared to Francis Taverner, requesting him to ensure his son's rightful inheritance, eventually instigating a lawsuit. The ghost reappeared multiple times, threatening Taverner, who eventually delivered the message, leading to a trial before Bishop Jeremy Taylor. The chapter also describes a witch rescued by the Devil from execution, Dr. Daniel Williams's experience freeing a girl from poltergeist-like disturbances in Dublin, and apparitions seen in the air over Co. Tipperary. It includes cases of bewitchment leading to death, such as Rev. James Shaw and his wife, and a fairy-possessed butler who was seen rising from the ground. Finally, it notes supposed witchcraft in Co. Cork and instances of the Devil appearing at Quaker meetings in Ireland."

    {
      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER VII: AN IRISH-AMERICAN WITCH (A.D. 1688)",
      "summary": "This chapter focuses on the case of Mrs. Glover, an Irish-American woman accused of witchcraft in Boston in 1688, which is considered a precursor to the Salem witch trials. Mrs. Glover, described as a 'Scandalous Irish Woman,' was accused by the Goodwin children after one of them became ill following an argument. The children experienced violent fits, physical distortions, and temporary blindness, deafness, and dumbness. Glover was committed after giving a 'Wretched Account of herself,' and her house search revealed 'Images, or Poppets, or Babies, made of Raggs and stuffed with Goat's Hair.' She confessed to tormenting victims by wetting her finger with spittle and stroking these images. During her trial, she could only speak Irish, attributed to a spell, and struggled to recite the Lord's Prayer. She claimed an incubus named her 'Prince' from whom she received wealth. After her execution, the Goodwin children's torments continued, attributed by Glover to others. The chapter notes Cotton Mather's detailed documentation and his belief in the validity of the witchcraft, highlighting how this case influenced subsequent outbreaks of accusations."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER VIII: A.D. 1689-1720",
      "summary": "This chapter recounts several events related to the supernatural and witchcraft. It begins with a portent during James II's entry into Dublin in 1689, where the mace fell, and the cross on its crown stuck between stones, seen as an ill omen. It then details a 1698 Antrim witch-story where a girl was tormented after consuming a sorrel leaf given by a witch, leading to violent fits and vomiting of various objects like needles, pins, and glass. The witch was apprehended, condemned, and burnt. A traditional version suggests the witch was a persecuted old woman stabbed to death, whose ghost haunted the session-house. The chapter also mentions a Scotch girl delated by the Kirk for using charms (from an Irish wise woman) to discover her future husband. Finally, it presents the Island-Magee witch trial of 1711, the last instance of judicial condemnation for witchcraft in Ireland. Mary Dunbar, the 'afflicted' girl, described invisible torments, mysterious movements of objects, and identified seven women as her tormentors through visions and descriptions. The women were tried, found guilty based on circumstantial evidence (like Mary's descriptions matching Janet Mean's crooked fingers), and sentenced to a year's imprisonment and four times in the pillory. The chapter concludes by mentioning Dr. Francis Hutchinson, a prominent critic of witchcraft belief who later became an Irish Bishop."

    {
      "chapter_title": "CHAPTER IX: A.D. 1807 TO PRESENT DAY",
      "summary": "This final chapter explores the persistence and evolution of magical beliefs in Ireland after formal witch trials ceased. It describes the 1808 Carnmoney witch trial of Mary Butters, who was sought to cure a bewitched cow that produced no butter. Her ritual involved boiling milk with pins and needles, which led to the death of three people by suffocation. Butters was discharged, claiming a 'black man' killed the victims. The chapter includes a ballad satirizing the event. It details a 1871 Newtownards case where a farm-hand used a similar method to banish witches troubling cows. The use of the 'Hand of Glory' by Irish thieves in 1831 to paralyze occupants during a robbery is recounted. A story from the Dublin University Magazine describes air travel via a red cap and twig, ending in a castle in England. Modern instances include a 1911 case where an old-age pensioner was tried for killing another woman she believed to be a witch, and contemporary beliefs in pishogues, bone-setters, and charms for milk-magic, cattle-magic (e.g., hare sucking cows, stealing butter with dew-gathering), disease transference by a 'cailleach,' and the malignant 'burying the sheaf' ritual. The chapter concludes by noting that 'Witchcraft, Inchantment, Sorcery, Magic Arts' remain theoretically recognized in the Irish Commission of the Peace, reflecting persistent underlying superstitions in society despite scientific advancement."

Its technical precision in detailing accusations, trials, and folk practices—including specific rituals, tools, and perceived effects—makes it an invaluable resource for understanding the operative side of historical magic within an Irish context. The work highlights the blending of formal witchcraft conceptions (often Anglo-Norman/Protestant) with indigenous Celtic superstitions (pishogues), thereby contextualizing Irish practices within broader Western Esoteric and Occult traditions while emphasizing local distinctiveness and comparative mildness of persecution. It is a critical text for any scholar or practitioner seeking to understand the historical evolution and manifestation of magical systems in a specific geographical and cultural setting.",
