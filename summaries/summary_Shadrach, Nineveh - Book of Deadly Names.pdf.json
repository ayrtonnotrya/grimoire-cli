    "description": "The operational system is a form of commanding magic, focusing on the specific powers of 72 individual Jinn revealed to King Solomon. For each Jinn, the book identifies its unique 'corruption' (the problem or sphere of influence it governs) and prescribes a precise 'medicine'—a detailed magical operation or remedy. This 'medicine' typically combines specific natural and animal-derived ingredients, the inscription and use of talismans (amulets), and the precise recitation or application of powerful Arabic names, with phonetic guidance. The practitioner's task is to identify the Jinn corresponding to their need or problem, then meticulously execute the described 'medicine' to either counteract the Jinn's negative influence or compel it to perform the desired magical outcome.",

My corruption is that if I seize a person, I shake him with convulsions.' Fiqlitush said, 'The medicine for this, O prophet of God, is a black cat and its urine.

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant to the study of grimoire traditions, particularly those connected to King Solomon and the rich, complex history of Arabic/Islamic magical practices involving Jinn. It presents itself not as a theoretical treatise but as a practical grimoire, offering a translated text claiming direct revelation from a Jinn King. Its blend of Gematria with physical ingredients grounds it simultaneously in qabalistic numerology and folk magical herbalism. As a unique 'translated' primary source (given the translator's claim), it offers significant insights into cross-cultural exchanges in magical traditions and operative spirit conjuration techniques, bridging Abrahamic esoteric currents with specific Jinn lore.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience includes practitioners of practical magic, particularly those interested in Solomonic magic, grimoire traditions, or direct spirit communication with Jinn. Scholars of esotericism, occultism, comparative religion, and Middle Eastern folklore will also find it invaluable for its unique content and historical context. Individuals seeking specific methods for protection, healing, cursing, or compelling spiritual entities would also find this text appealing."
