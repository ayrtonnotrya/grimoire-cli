      "summary": "This section details the methodical steps for performing energetic cleansing using a Firebowl. It begins with an initial assessment of the 'energetic feeling' of the space, followed by charging the Firebowl according to class instructions for a 'two-element' cleansing. After the cleansing, practitioners are instructed to record results, difficulties, and questions, and to re-evaluate the energetic quality of the space, noting any changes over the subsequent days."

      "summary": "This section outlines an experimental protocol for evaluating incenses and resins. It instructs practitioners to test single substances in the Firebowl (with or without charcoal as appropriate), observing and recording their scent upon burning, the behavior of the smoke, their physical appearance before burning, and finally, their 'elemental makeup' alongside any other pertinent observations."
