It provides a framework and practical techniques for 'memetic engineering' and 'self-empowerment' by consciously designing and transmitting memes to influence individual consciousness, group minds (egregores), and social systems, thereby shaping reality.",

It contextualizes traditional magical concepts (like egregores, sigils, and belief manipulation) within modern frameworks of memetics, cybernetics, and marketing. This approach allows practitioners to understand and operate within the 'hyperreal world of post-modern discourse' by leveraging cultural, psychological, and informational dynamics, thereby bridging the perceived gap between magic and science.",

It also targets individuals interested in self-empowerment through understanding and manipulating social and psychological systems. Furthermore, artists, writers, and marketers seeking innovative ways to influence culture and promote their work by applying memetic and narrative strategies would find this book valuable. The 'PIRATE Edition' ethos suggests an audience that is independent, proactive, and willing to challenge established norms."
