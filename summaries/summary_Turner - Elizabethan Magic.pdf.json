      "chapter_title": "Foreword by Colin Wilson",
      "summary": "Wilson introduces the book, highlighting the perceived bewilderment modern readers might feel towards the Elizabethan belief in magic. He argues for a 'sympathetic attention' to historical mages like Dee and Kelly, dismissing the 'credulous dupe' theory for Dee. Wilson discusses the historical and rediscovered reality of paranormal phenomena, such as clairvoyance and poltergeists, and suggests a re-evaluation of 'magic' as an earlier, crude form of science."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book meticulously describes several historical magical systems. John Dee's Angelic (Enochian) magic, received via scryer Edward Kelly, involves a complex hierarchy of angels, a unique alphabet, and 48 'Keys' or 'Calls' for planetary and elemental magic. This system utilizes consecrated ritual tools to facilitate communication with divine beings and influence the terrestrial sphere. Simon Forman's practice is presented as more rooted in grimoire traditions, focusing on conjuring spirits (often perceived as demonic) for diverse purposes including discovering hidden treasures and crafting magical remedies. Robert Fludd's geomancy is detailed as a divinatory method involving the construction and interpretation of figures derived from random dot patterns, used for character assessment and prognostication. The book also highlights Robert Turner's translations of works like 'Ars Notoria' and Agrippa's 'Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy', which provide further insights into practical applications of memory magic and angel invocation as understood in the 17th century.",
