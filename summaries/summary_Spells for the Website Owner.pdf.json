  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system presented is a form of highly accessible, results-oriented 'cyber magic' or 'technomancy'. It integrates fundamental occult principles, particularly sympathetic magic, visualization, and the charging of objects, with everyday digital tasks and online business objectives. The mechanics are simple: an intention is set (e.g., more money, visitors), a corresponding magical act is performed using common items or mental techniques (e.g., drawing symbols, chanting, physical actions like mailing an envelope or placing chalk in shoes), and the practitioner maintains belief and focus. The system emphasizes the power of intention and symbolic action to influence outcomes in the virtual realm, treating the website and its associated activities as extensions of the practitioner's magical sphere. It provides a toolkit for actively imbuing digital work with magical potency.",
