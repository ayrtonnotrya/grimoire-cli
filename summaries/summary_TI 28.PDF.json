    "description": "The practical system centers on cultivating 'right comprehension' through receptivity and meditation, guided by the symbolism of the Tarot. The core practice involves meditative states aimed at accessing the Life-power's wisdom, distinguishing between external sensory impressions and internal intuitions, and ultimately identifying the personal will with the Universal Will. This leads to a transformation of consciousness and mastery over conditions, embodying the principles of 'The Great Work.' The system is structured into daily meditations, each assigned specific Tarot keys, focusing on developing specific attitudes and realizations, such as Universal Mind presence, problem-solving through the True Self, transformation into a likeness of the True Self, identification with Universal Life, and detachment from forms.",
