      "Bowl (glass, pottery, or plastic; wide at the rim; beautiful or personally meaningful)",
      "Clean water (enough to fill the bowl nearly to the brim)",

      "Private area (undisturbed, suitable for casting a circle if accustomed, with all other light sources eliminated)"
    ],
    "rituals": [
      "**Preparation Ritual**: Choose a personally meaningful bowl. Add clean water to the brim. Transport the bowl to a private, undisturbed area, ideally where one casts a circle. Set the mood with a single candle, eliminating all other light sources to achieve near darkness. Position a low table and sit as close to the earth as possible, placing the bowl at an angle for comfortable viewing.",
      "**Mirror Creation/Activation**: Add approximately one ounce of washable black ink to the water in the bowl. Observe the ink swirling, obscuring the water's clarity, and begin to perceive the formation of 'mysterious power' within the waters.",
      "**Scrying Ritual**: Relax, take several deep breaths, and slowly peer into the blackness of the water. Notice the emergence of cloudiness or mist over the bowl, which will evolve into scenes from other times and places. While maintaining visual focus on the bowl, chant slowly and softly: 'Mirror, mirror, cry for me,' 'Mirror, mirror, let me see,' 'As I will, so mote it be.'",
      "**Vision Interpretation & Command**: Interpret the revealed secrets and visions. If visions are upsetting, command a favorable ending and visualize it, knowing that the Universe can provide. The practitioner retains the power to end visions at will. Practice is encouraged for accurate interpretation and enhanced efficacy in creating and attracting desired outcomes."
