      "summary": "Examines the 19th-century revival of Rosicrucianism in France and introduces H. Spencer Lewis, founder of AMORC. It covers Lewis's background, claims of psychic abilities, and the establishment of the Institute for Psychic Research. The text scrutinizes the purported origins of American Rosicrucianism through German Pietists like Johannes Kelpius and critiques Lewis's claims of inherited manuscripts, suggesting J.F. Sachse as a more probable source."

      "summary": "This section recounts Spencer Lewis's trips to France (1909, 1926/1929), his alleged meetings with Rosicrucian dignitaries in Paris and Toulouse, and a significant initiation. The author critically analyzes these events as likely symbolic rather than literal, particularly concerning François Galabert. It details the 'Birth of AMORC' in 1915, its early leadership, and Lewis's reported public transmutation of zinc into gold."

The 'Modern AMORC' section highlights controversies and rivalry among Rosicrucian groups (AMORC, Rosicrucian Fellowship, Quakertown Rosicrucians), often characterized by accusations of fraud and internal disputes over authenticity."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Martinist Filiation and Ethical Controversies",
      "summary": "Introduces the Martinist Initiatic line (Martinez Pasquales, Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin, Papus) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Martinist Order. It details the formation and eventual dissolution of FUDOSI, attributing its demise to AMORC's 'self-aggrandizement' and 'intimidation tactics' against other member orders."

      "summary": "This section chronicles the 'irregular' Traditional Martinist Order (TMO) under AMORC, its alleged 'bogus S.I. Degrees,' and its ostracization by other Martinist groups. It documents the internal conflict at AMORC, leading to the deposition of Imperator Gary L. Stewart in 1990, who maintained his title as TMO Grand Master. The text includes internal correspondence and newspaper articles detailing TMO's 'inconsistencies' and invalid initiations, alongside AMORC's disciplinary actions against members affiliating with rival Martinist groups."
