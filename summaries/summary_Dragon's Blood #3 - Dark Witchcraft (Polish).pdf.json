Key methods include astral projection, conscious dream control, sexual mysticism (e.g., 'unions de sagesse'), and invocations of dark deities and demonic entities to achieve altered states of consciousness and gnosis. The goal is to transmute disintegrating shadow forces into creative power, leading to liberation from perceived limitations and the awakening of one's inner 'Dragon' (Kundalini).",
