Each card's divinatory meaning is meticulously analyzed through a standardized framework of eight categories: Key Words (primary meanings), General Description (usage and nuances), Love, Career, Characteristics/Qualities, Medicine, Timing Guide, and Astrological Correspondence.

This framework provides comprehensive tools for practical card readings across various life domains.",
