  "central_thesis": "Individuals experiencing 'broken relationships' (bereavement, separation, or divorce) are more likely to report belief in and experiences of the paranormal. This phenomenon, replicated across multiple studies, is hypothesized to stem from the psychological trauma associated with such relationships, paralleling the known link between childhood trauma and adult paranormal belief. Paranormal claims are suggested to function as a defense mechanism or coping strategy to regain a sense of control following trauma.",

      "chapter_title": "Introduction and Initial Observation",
      "summary": "The paper introduces the recurring finding that people from 'broken relationships' (bereaved, separated, or divorced) tend to report more paranormal beliefs and experiences. This effect is initially highlighted through a 1974 study by John Palmer, which found higher reports of waking ESP, ESP dreams, out-of-the-body experiences, apparitions, and hauntings among separated/divorced and widowed respondents."

      "chapter_title": "Replication of the 'Broken Relationship Effect'",
      "summary": "The author details five subsequent replications of this finding. These include a 1991 multinational human values study (Haraldsson & Houtkooper) involving 18,607 respondents, two studies by Thalbourne (1994, 1996) using the Australian Sheep-Goat Scale, and two confirmatory studies by Zingrone and Alvarado (1997) utilizing a Psi Index across diverse samples. All consistently showed a higher incidence of paranormal claims among individuals from 'broken' marital statuses."

      "chapter_title": "Exploring the Underlying Causes: Trauma as a Common Factor",
      "summary": "The paper posits that the 'broken relationship effect' is a specific instance of a broader principle: trauma, regardless of its developmental stage, can lead to claims of the paranormal. It draws parallels with studies linking childhood trauma (e.g., abuse, loss, parental divorce) to adult paranormal belief and experience (Irwin, Lawrence et al., Terr et al.). Emotional strain accompanying broken relationships is identified as the key traumatic component."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Proposed Mechanism and Future Research",
      "summary": "The author suggests that engaging in paranormal ways of thinking or perceiving (e.g., sensing a deceased loved one) may serve as a psychological defense mechanism, allowing individuals to cope with trauma and regain a sense of control over their lives. Future research is proposed to develop a comprehensive lifetime trauma questionnaire, predicting that those most traumatized will exhibit the strongest paranormal beliefs and experiences."

      "term": "Broken Relationship Effect",
      "definition": "The statistically significant tendency for individuals who are bereaved, separated, or divorced to report a greater number of paranormal-related experiences and stronger paranormal beliefs compared to single or married individuals. This term is used within a parapsychological context to describe a social-psychological correlation."
    },
    {
      "term": "Trauma (as a precursor to paranormal claims)",
      "definition": "Any significant emotional or psychological distress, whether originating in childhood (e.g., physical abuse, loss) or adulthood (e.g., marital dissolution, bereavement). The paper suggests trauma is the common factor underlying both childhood and adult experiences that lead to an increased likelihood of paranormal belief and experience claims. It is viewed as a psychological event rather than an occult initiation."
    },
    {
      "term": "Defense Mechanism (in parapsychology)",
      "definition": "A psychological coping strategy where paranormal belief and experience (whether 'real' or imagined) are evoked by trauma. This mechanism helps the individual cope with distress, regain a sense of order, or reinstate a 'calmer pre-trauma status,' as exemplified by bereaved individuals sensing the presence of the deceased. This term is used in a psychological, not magical, sense."

    {
      "term": "Australian Sheep-Goat Scale",
      "definition": "A questionnaire designed to measure an individual's belief in, and alleged experience of, paranormal phenomena. 'Sheep' typically refers to believers/experiencers, while 'Goats' refer to skeptics/non-experiencers. It is a psychometric tool used in parapsychological research."
    },
    {
      "term": "Psi Index",
      "definition": "A quantitative measure used in some studies to assess the number of ostensible psychic experiences reported by respondents. It serves as an empirical metric for paranormal experience claims within a research context."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "This paper does not describe a practical system for magic or any esoteric practice. Instead, it presents a psychological hypothesis and supporting empirical evidence regarding the origins of paranormal belief and experience. It suggests that such experiences might serve as a coping mechanism for individuals who have undergone significant emotional trauma due to broken relationships.",

      "text": "From the point of view of the person, one way of solving the problem of trauma and regaining some control over one's life might be to engage in ways of thinking and perceiving that reinstate the relatively calmer pre-trauma status, as for example the common situation where a bereaved person appears to sense in some way the presence of the deceased.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant to the psychological and parapsychological understanding of belief formation and anomalous experiences. For the field of Western Esotericism and Occultism, its relevance is indirect: it offers a scientific, psychological framework for understanding why individuals might report experiences or hold beliefs that align with occult concepts (e.g., communication with the dead, psychic abilities). It suggests that personal trauma, rather than inherent magical ability or external occult forces, may underpin the genesis of such claims, providing a potential counter-narrative or complementary psychological context for some 'magical' experiences.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience includes academic researchers in parapsychology, social psychology, and clinical psychology, particularly those interested in trauma, belief systems, and anomalous experiences. It would also appeal to sociologists studying cultural beliefs and possibly psychotherapists working with individuals experiencing grief or trauma who report unusual perceptions. It is not intended for practitioners of Western Esotericism or Occultism seeking practical magical instruction or philosophical insights into magical systems."
