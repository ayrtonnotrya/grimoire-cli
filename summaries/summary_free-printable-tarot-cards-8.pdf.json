  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The provided material functions primarily as an advertisement and does not itself detail a practical magical or divinatory system, nor does it elaborate on operative mechanics. It visually showcases examples of Tarot cards from the Cups suit, implying that the advertised website ('discover-the-meaning-of-tarot.com') offers a system for interpreting these cards within a cartomantic framework. The 'how' of this implied system would typically involve selecting or drawing cards in specific layouts and interpreting their symbolic meanings relative to a question or situation, focusing on gaining insight rather than direct magical manipulation as found in grimoire traditions.",
    "tools": [
      "A Tarot deck is the central tool, with specific cards from the Cups suit of the Minor Arcana (Ten of Cups, Nine of Cups, Queen of Cups, Page of Cups, Knight of Cups, King of Cups) visually represented. These cards appear to be from, or heavily inspired by, a historical deck such as the Visconti-Sforza or similar early Italian Renaissance tradition."
    ],
    "rituals": [
      "No specific rituals are detailed within this promotional material. Traditional Tarot practice often involves preparatory steps such as cleansing the deck, shuffling techniques, cutting the deck, and laying out cards in various spreads (e.g., Celtic Cross, Three-Card Spread). Interpretation typically follows, considering card positions, relationships, and reversals. These practices, however, are not described in this snippet."

    "relevance": "As a standalone document, its relevance is limited to promotional advertisement, serving as a gateway to external information. Its primary value is in directing individuals to a resource that presumably offers foundational knowledge on Tarot card meanings. Without the linked website content, it lacks substantive educational or practical value in esotericism beyond visual identification of specific Tarot cards.",
    "target_audience": "Beginners and enthusiasts interested in learning the basic meanings of Tarot cards and exploring introductory cartomancy practices. It targets individuals seeking a convenient online resource for understanding Tarot symbolism and engaging in personal divination."
