It identifies various aspects of the Adversary as Shaitan/Iblis, Satan, Lucifer, Set, and Azazel, framing the practice as a pursuit of the 'fire-spirit of change, rebellion and progression' and equating Set with the 'solar creative (and destructive) force of change and self-deification'."

It is an invocation of the Djinn of Fire, calling upon the 'scorching sun,' 'Scorpion soul,' and 'Scorpion Flame' for 'fires of growth and illumination.' The ritual aims for the practitioner to 'become as' the Sun, transcend, ascend, and burn with 'Luciferian Light,' asserting personal power at the 'Crossroads' through specific incantations like 'Zazas, Zazas, Nasatanada Zazas'."

The focus shifts to the 'Shadow,' 'darkness,' and 'Black Sun,' seeking hidden knowledge ('what has been never known'). The practitioner proclaims becoming the 'Peacock Angel beauty,' 'Imagination,' and 'Seed of Fallen Angel,' asserting their will to give birth to 'Incubi and Succubi' in the 'blood of the moon,' through incantations like 'Al Zabbat, Hekas Hekau, Serpent Soul do I summon'."

      "summary": "This concluding section explains the 'dual rite' as a means to command 'the entire approximation of self.' It clarifies that while Noon and Midnight are primary, both points can be used to raise focused energy. The commentary stresses that the ritual is about the practitioner's embodiment of the self within the 'perpetual mastery of the psyche' and the importance of 'gnosis' within the ritual circle. It positions the ritual, especially when combined with the 'Lord's Prayer Averse,' as a 'powerful foundation for self-deification in the Witches Sabbat Gnosis'."

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This text is highly relevant to contemporary Luciferian and Left Hand Path practices, particularly those focused on self-deification and the internal assimilation of adversarial forces rather than external worship. It adeptly integrates traditional demonic/adversarial archetypes (e.g., Iblis, Set, Lucifer) with modern self-empowerment magic, reflecting a syncretic approach common in modern occultism. The dualistic structure of Noon and Midnight rituals offers a comprehensive framework for integrating both solar (conscious, outward manifestation) and lunar (subconscious, inward transformation) aspects of the self into the adversarial current, promoting a holistic personal evolution. It stands as a clear example of modern Grimoire-style workings within the LHP.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of practitioners of Luciferianism, Sethianism, and other Left Hand Path occultists. It would also appeal to Chaos Magicians exploring archetypal currents and individuals interested in rituals of self-deification and adversarial gnosis. Familiarity with occult concepts, magical terminology, and a willingness to engage with challenging, antinomian symbolism are prerequisites for engaging with this material effectively."
