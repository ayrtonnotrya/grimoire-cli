  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system outlined is a collection of folk-magical 'tests of fate' and charms designed to reveal aspects of an individual's future, primarily focusing on love, marriage, wealth, and destiny. The efficacy of these practices is explicitly linked to the liminal energy of Hallow-e'en, when 'elves, fairies, goblins and hobgoblins are at large'. The system relies heavily on various forms of divination (augury, cleromancy, hydromancy, pyromancy, scrying, oneiromancy) using easily accessible objects and simple rituals, often requiring specific actions (e.g., silence, blindfolds, specific timings like midnight) to enhance their prophetic power. The core mechanic is that symbolic actions or random outcomes, interpreted through traditional folk wisdom, manifest insights into one's personal future, making it an operative guide for convivial prognostication.",

    "relevance": "This text offers a valuable historical and ethnographic insight into early 20th-century American folk-magical practices associated with Halloween. It demonstrates how traditional divinatory techniques, often rooted in ancient agricultural and spiritual beliefs concerning the liminal nature of Samhain, were adapted into social games and party rituals. The work bridges the gap between folklore and practical application, showing how subtle magical operations for prognostication (especially regarding romance and fortune) were integrated into secular celebrations, reflecting a period where folk magic remained a tangible, if playful, aspect of cultural life. Its systematic cataloging of diverse divinatory methods using common household items makes it a practical, albeit introductory, manual for understanding accessible folk magic traditions.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience is individuals, particularly young adults and hosts, planning Halloween parties and seeking to incorporate traditional, romantic, or amusing fortune-telling and charm practices. It caters to those interested in the 'mystery' and 'fun' of Hallow-e'en, with an emphasis on social entertainment rather than rigorous esoteric study or advanced occult practice. It appeals to a general audience with a casual interest in superstition, folklore, and lighthearted prognostication."
