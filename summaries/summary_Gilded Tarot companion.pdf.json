Some people believe that the seventy-eight cards of the tarot already represent a full range of human experience and reversals just muddy the waters. New students of tarot often feel intimidated by learning yet another set of seventy-eight meanings. Others argue that using reversals adds depth, subtlety, and accuracy to a reading, and that reversals are a way of fine-tuning your interpretations.",

    "relevance": "The Gilded Tarot Companion serves as a highly relevant and practical entry point into tarot, particularly for users of Ciro Marchetti's deck. It distills complex symbolism into accessible insights, emphasizing a personal, intuitive engagement with the cards rather than rigid adherence to esoteric dogma. While it doesn't delve into deep qabalistic or astrological correspondences typical of more advanced occult texts, it provides a solid operational framework for divination and self-reflection. Its value lies in its pragmatic approach, encouraging direct interaction with the visual art and fostering an individualized understanding of tarot for practical problem-solving and spiritual growth.",
    "target_audience": "This book is primarily aimed at beginner to intermediate tarot practitioners, particularly those who are new to the Gilded Tarot deck or wish to deepen their understanding of it.

Its straightforward language and emphasis on experiential learning make it suitable for a broad audience seeking a user-friendly introduction to tarot practice."
