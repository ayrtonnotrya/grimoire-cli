The book's critical approach to academic biases in religious studies helps to validate the esoteric focus on suppressed traditions and offers a framework for understanding the re-emergence of goddess worship. It explicitly links to figures like Dion Fortune and Margaret Murray, key figures in the history of modern occultism, making it a foundational text for exploring the historical and archetypal dimensions of feminine power in magic.",
