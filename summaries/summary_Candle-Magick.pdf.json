It emphasizes the primacy of intent and color over candle shape, offers guidance on selecting colors based on goals, elements, or intuition, and provides instructions for extinguishing flames respectfully. It details the necessity of using new candles, methods for disposing of spell leftovers (varying by spell type), and discusses various approaches to lighting candles.

Each entry provides the color's associated element (where applicable), its general magical properties, and specific applications in spellwork (e.g., Yellow for mental clarity, Red for passion, Green for prosperity, Purple for spiritual expansion, Black for protection). It also includes a theoretical discussion on the nature of black and white concerning color perception (light vs. pigment) and how adding white, grey, or black to colors modifies their vibrational energy and magical effect."

      "term": "Extinguishing Flame",
      "definition": "The act of putting out a candle flame. It is ritually significant; one should never blow out a flame to avoid disrespecting the Spirit of Fire. Instead, a snuffer or athame/knife should be used, often preceded by an expression of gratitude."

      "term": "New Candle Rule",
      "definition": "The practice of using only new candles for each spell or ritual to prevent 'confusing energies' from previous workings from interfering with the current magical intent."
    },
    {
      "term": "Disposing of Leftovers",
      "definition": "Specific methods for discarding candle stubs and drippings after a spell. For banishing spells, leftovers are buried off-property (or in public trash for urban practitioners); for attraction spells, they are buried on-property, in a potted plant/soil, or carried as an amulet, using imagination for suitable methods."
    },
    {
      "term": "Dressing/Anointing Candle",
      "definition": "A ritualistic process of rubbing oil (often a vegetable oil base with essential oils) onto a candle to imbue it with specific energies. It involves distinct hand movements (power hand top-to-middle, receptive hand middle-to-bottom) while maintaining focus on the spell's goal. Crushed herbs may also be rolled onto the candle at this stage."
    },
    {
      "term": "Empowerment",
      "definition": "The process of charging a candle and a spell with the practitioner's intention and energy. This is achieved by holding the goal clearly in mind during all preparatory steps (inscribing, dressing) and visualizing the desired outcome as already complete, often reinforced with verbal affirmations or chants."
    },
    {
      "term": "Harm None",
      "definition": "An ethical guideline emphasizing that a spell should be formulated to cause no harm, including to the practitioner, thereby preventing potential negative repercussions or 'backfiring' of the magick."

      "definition": "Symbolizes spirituality, raises vibrations, repels negative energies, emotional healing, balancing, contact with spirit guides, wholeness, purity, truth, and contains/balances all colors. Can substitute for any other color. In light, it contains all colors; in pigment, it's the absence of color. Adding white to a color raises its vibrations and adds gentleness."

    {
      "term": "Black",
      "definition": "Represents all colors in pigment theory (when all colors are mixed). Associated with protection, binding, repelling, ending unwanted situations, thoughts, or magick, and the subconscious. In light, it is the absence of light.

The detailed color correspondences are a valuable resource, and the practical 'pointers' demystify common ritualistic elements, making magick approachable while maintaining respect for established esoteric principles. It bridges traditional symbolism with an adaptable, practitioner-centric approach, making it useful for beginners and a good refresher for experienced practitioners.",
