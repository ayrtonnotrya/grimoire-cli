    "description": "The Rosicrucian Spread is a 22-card Tarot system centered on a Rose Cross diagram. It involves selecting 22 cards (typically the Major Arcana) and laying them out according to the diagram, where each position corresponds to a specific Major Arcana card, Hebrew letter, and elemental/planetary/zodiacal attribute. The system facilitates a layered interpretation, from core elemental issues to broader planetary influences and zodiacal lessons. It emphasizes 'unfurling' the spread to trace pathways between related positions, providing answers to specific spiritual and existential questions.",
