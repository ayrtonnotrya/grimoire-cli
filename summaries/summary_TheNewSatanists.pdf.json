The 'magic' is largely portrayed as psychological manipulation, a means to justify criminal acts, or a source of 'thrill highs' for adolescents leading to violence.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "From an esoteric and occult perspective, 'The New Satanists' serves primarily as a historical document reflecting the intense 'Satanic Panic' era of the late 20th century. It lacks genuine engagement with esoteric traditions, instead presenting a highly alarmist and often sensationalized account of alleged criminal activities attributed to 'satanic cults.' The book's analysis of magic is rudimentary and framed entirely through a lens of fear and moral condemnation, conflating genuine magical practice with criminal behavior and psychological deviance. Its value to a practitioner or academic in esotericism is limited to understanding the societal anxieties and misinterpretations that have historically demonized occultism, rather than offering any insights into operative magic or philosophy.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes the general public, parents, law enforcement, social workers, and counselors concerned with cults and child abuse. It is specifically aimed at those seeking to understand and combat what the author perceives as the dangers of criminal Satanism, rather than scholars or practitioners of Western Esotericism and Occultism."
