Its comprehensive structure, detailed instructions for planetary timing, ritual purity, instrument consecration, and spirit conjuration laid the groundwork for countless subsequent magical systems, most notably the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and various Solomonic traditions. The text's emphasis on divine authority over spirits, achieved through rigorous preparatory work and the precise use of divine names and symbols, distinguishes it from less structured magical approaches. While considered by some to be a medieval fabrication, its perceived authenticity and profound impact on occult thought ensure its continued study and adaptation by practitioners and scholars. Its blend of Abrahamic religious elements with astrological and qabalistic correspondences makes it a unique and enduring artifact of Western magical practice.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience for 'The Key of Solomon the King' comprises serious practitioners of ceremonial magic, occultists, and scholars of Western Esotericism. It is not an introductory text for beginners, requiring a significant commitment to study, ritual discipline, and a willingness to engage with complex astrological, qabalistic, and theological concepts. Its detailed instructions and emphasis on rigorous preparation make it suitable for those seeking to undertake formal spirit evocation or to delve deeply into the historical grimoire tradition. The text's demand for moral purity and meticulous ritual execution also appeals to those who view magic as a spiritual discipline rather than merely a means to achieve mundane desires."
