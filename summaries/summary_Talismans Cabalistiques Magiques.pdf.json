  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system revolves around constructing and consecrating talismans. It begins with the rigorous calculation of Divine, angelic, or demonic names using Kabbalistic techniques (Gematria, Ziruph) derived from planetary magic squares and specific magical scripts (e.g., Celestial, Malachim). The selection of the correct astrological timing (planetary hours, days, lunar mansions, fixed star conjunctions) is paramount. Talismans are then drawn or engraved on appropriate materials (metals, parchment) corresponding to the target planet or entity, incorporating sigils and names. The system implies preparatory rites for the magician, including purification and knowledge of celestial influences, to facilitate communication with and invocation of the chosen intelligences.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This grimoire is a crucial historical artifact for understanding the synthesis of Kabbalistic and astrological magic in early modern Western Esotericism. It provides a highly systematic and detailed framework for talismanic magic, distinguishing itself through its emphasis on numerical and linguistic calculations (Gematria, Ziruph) alongside traditional planetary correspondences. The inclusion of human anatomical proportions as a microcosmic link further roots it in Hermetic philosophy. Its detailed practical instructions make it highly relevant for historical studies of magical practice and comparative analyses with other grimoire traditions, such as the Key of Solomon or Picatrix.",
