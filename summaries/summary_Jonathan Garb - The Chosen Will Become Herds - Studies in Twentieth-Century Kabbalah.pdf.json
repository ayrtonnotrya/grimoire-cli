  "central_thesis": "Jonathan Garb's 'The Chosen Will Become Herds' argues that twentieth-century Kabbalah underwent profound transformations, shifting from an esoteric, theosophical-theurgical tradition to a more popularized, psychologically, nationally, and socio-economically oriented phenomenon. This 'modern Kabbalah' often intertwined with New Age movements, reinterpreting traditional concepts like power, sacred space, and Halakha, and frequently embraced innovative, sometimes anomian or antinomian, practices.",

    {
      "chapter_title": "Introduction: The Study of Twentieth-Century Kabbalah: Dilemmas and Possibilities",
      "summary": "This section contextualizes twentieth-century Kabbalah within the broader landscape of modern mysticism, including the New Age movement. It highlights the academic challenges and intellectual biases in studying contemporary mystical phenomena, differentiating 'classical' from 'modern' Kabbalah by focusing on its innovative, often postmodern, characteristics."

    {
      "chapter_title": "1. Jewish Mysticism in the Twentieth Century: Major Trends",
      "summary": "A survey of the significant expansion and changing social, political, and economic influence of Kabbalah in Israel and globally. It outlines key trends within Hasidic, Lithuanian, Oriental-Sephardic, and Religious-Zionist spheres, noting the proliferation of mystical literature, courses, festivals, and the emergence of new kabbalistic figures and movements."

    {
      "chapter_title": "2. The Drive to Disseminate Kabbalah",
      "summary": "Explores the internal (ideological) and external (sociological) motivations for the widespread dissemination of Kabbalah in the 20th century. Focuses on the doctrines of R. Avraham Yizhaq Ha-Kohen Kook and R. Yehuda Leib Ha-Levi Ashlag, highlighting their justifications for making Kabbalah accessible to wider audiences, often linking it to messianic redemption and personal transformation, alongside discussing opposition to this trend."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "3. The Concept of Power in National Mysticism",
      "summary": "Analyzes how the concept of 'power' transformed in twentieth-century national mysticism, particularly within Religious Zionism. It contrasts Hasidic and Lurianic views of power, focusing on R. Kook's integration of Nietzschean/Bergsonian ideas with Kabbalistic concepts, often expressed through his personal prophetic experiences and national revival. It also examines the implications of this concept in the Jewish Underground's theurgical actions related to the Temple Mount."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "4. Psychological Notions of Power",
      "summary": "This chapter focuses on the psychological dimension of power, especially within R. Yehuda Leib Ha-Levi Ashlag's circle. It details Ashlag's doctrine of altruism ('desire to give' vs. 'desire to receive') as a psychological and ethical path to spiritual elevation, contrasting it with Kook's national focus. It also touches on Ginsburgh's radical interpretations of ego destruction and the general reluctance of these circles to engage in overt magical practices."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "5. Sacred Space and Sacred Persons",
      "summary": "Examines the evolution of 'sacred space' in 20th-century Kabbalah, showing its increasing subordination to the 'sacred person' (Tzaddiq). It contrasts classical geographical interpretations with modern, individualized concepts, illustrating how figures like Kook, Habad rebbes, and Bratzlav Tzaddiqim became focal points of sacredness, often transcending physical locations or traditional religious structures."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "6. Circumvention and Violation of Halakha",
      "summary": "Investigates the emergence and intensification of anomian (extra-halakhic) and antinomian (Halakha violation) tendencies in twentieth-century Kabbalah. It traces these trends from historical precedents, exploring R. Kook's prophetic justification for overriding Halakha, the practices of neo-Hasidic groups, and the Jewish Underground's radical interpretations. It argues that a decline in theurgical emphasis and a rise in anthropocentric focus contributed to the erosion of Halakha's centrality."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "7. The Upsurge of Mysticism as a Jewish and Global Phenomenon",
      "summary": "This concluding chapter synthesizes the global (New Age), Israeli, and internal Jewish religious changes that propelled the surge in mysticism. It characterizes the New Age as a multicultural, decentralized movement. It discusses the secularization of Kabbalah, its commercialization, and the integration of alternative practices into Jewish spiritual life, noting its relationship with postmodernism and the revitalization of individual identity."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Postscript",
      "summary": "Offers a brief reflection on the book's scope and limitations, acknowledging the dynamic nature of contemporary Kabbalah. It reiterates the major themes of exotericism, power, nationalism, psychologization of mysticism, the status of the leader and space, and attitudes towards law as central to understanding twentieth-century Kabbalah's development and future orientations."

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant for specialists in Western Esotericism and Occultism as it offers a meticulous academic analysis of the modernization and popularization of Jewish Kabbalah. It systematically maps the shifts in Kabbalistic thought from traditional esoteric forms to psychological, national, and commercially influenced expressions, including interactions with the New Age movement. The author's distinction between classical and modern Kabbalah, and his detailed examination of anomian/antinomian trends, provide crucial context for understanding the diverse landscape of contemporary magical and mystical practices that draw from Kabbalistic sources. For practitioners, it illuminates the historical and sociological underpinnings of various Kabbalistic schools and their often-divergent approaches to authority, ritual, and spiritual power.",
    "target_audience": "Academic scholars of Jewish Studies, Religious Studies, Western Esotericism, and Sociology of Religion. It is also highly valuable for occult practitioners and enthusiasts interested in the historical, philosophical, and sociological evolution of Kabbalah, particularly those engaging with contemporary or New Age interpretations of Kabbalistic practice."
