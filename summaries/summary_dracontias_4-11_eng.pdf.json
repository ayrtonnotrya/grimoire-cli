      "summary": "This article by Thomas K. details the journey through Paroketh, the 'minor abyss' or 'realm of nightmares,' which serves as a veil to Thagirion, the world of the Black Sun. It introduces three female initiators—Qoohm-In, Zi-Qoohm, and Qoohm-Zi—who guide the adept through the tunnels of Paroketh, facilitating the confrontation with the shadow and union with the black light of Thagirion. The process is characterized by horror, eroticism, and aligns with Tarot cards The Devil, Art, and Death."

      "summary": "Axel explores the intrinsic link between learning ('scientia') and initiation within the draconian path. It posits knowledge as a prerequisite for initiation, guiding the adept's self-creation and value-refinement. The article introduces the 'visio vires actio' formula, where new insight leads to effective new actions, and discusses esoteric learning as a direct transmission of gnosis, often wordless, from various sources including entities and mentors, facilitated by language studies and the daimon."

      "summary": "Yiannis K. provides practical methods for accessing the 'dark side'—conceived as both an astral domain and a state of consciousness. The process involves channeling Vril power to Manipura chakra, then to the reptilian brain to form the 'Black Sphere' (a 'black point in consciousness'), which subsequently transforms into the 'Black Gate.' The article details a ritual involving meditation, sigil gazing, and chanting ('zazas ZAZAS NASATANADA zazas') to open the Gate, emphasizing the need for control and faith despite potential terror and possession."

    "description": "The Dragon Rouge system is a progressive initiatory path focused on self-deification through exploration of the Qliphothic Tree and the Dark Side. It involves developing 'scientia' (knowledge) as a prerequisite for practical magical work, culminating in the manipulation of 'Vril' energy and alteration of consciousness. The system emphasizes confronting the 'shadow-self,' engaging with specific entities (e.g., Sorath's Initiatrices, Goetic demons), and journeying through non-physical realms to expand awareness and personal power.",
