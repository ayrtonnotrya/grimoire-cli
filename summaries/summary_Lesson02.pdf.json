This framework, rooted in the Vangelo delle Streghe creation myth, describes the emanation of the physical universe (God) from Spirit (Goddess) and the journey of individual souls (parts of the Goddess) through multiple lifetimes across seven planes of existence to ultimately reunite with the Divine, achievable through energy work, self-awareness, and magic.",
