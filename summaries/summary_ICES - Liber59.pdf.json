    {
      "term": "Catharism",
      "definition": "A dualistic Christian sect from southwestern France (12th-13th centuries) believing in two creative forces (God and a lower, evil being), the soul's captivity in matter, and salvation through Gnosis and an initiatory experience for 'Parfaits.' They practiced asceticism and believed in reincarnation."

    {
      "term": "Gnosis",
      "definition": "In Gnosticism, direct, inner spiritual knowledge or revelation, distinct from intellectual understanding or doctrine, leading to awareness of one's divine nature and destiny. Modern Gnosticism applies it more generally to inner realization of divinity."
    },
    {
      "term": "Dualism (Gnostic)",
      "definition": "The belief in two opposing creative principles: a good God who created the spiritual world, and a lower, evil being who created the material world, resulting in the soul's entrapment in matter. Varied in degree from moderate to radical within different Gnostic traditions."

    {
      "term": "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn",

      "term": "Steward (Masonic)",
      "definition": "Within Freemasonry, a Lodge officer, lowest in rank but esoterically crucial, symbolizing Malkuth and Yesod (Kingdom and Foundation) on the Tree of Life.

    },
    {
      "term": "Lambskin Apron (Masonic Symbolism)",
      "definition": "The distinguishing badge of an Entered Apprentice, symbolically representing purity of life and conduct. Esoterically, the Square signifies Man/Matter, the Triangle signifies Spirit, and the strings (Cable Tow) denote spiritual limitations. Its wearing demonstrates the relationship between Spirit and Matter (superimposed or involuted) and the Neofite's evolutionary status."

    "description": "The document outlines an esoteric system focused on spiritual self-development and the realization of one's divine nature through inner revelation ('Gnosis'), rather than mere doctrine. It emphasizes the concept of 'Stewardship' as a practical pathway, where initiates are entrusted with guarding and understanding esoteric mysteries. This involves self-discipline, inner work, and transmuting base human energies into spiritual illumination. The Masonic 'Entered Apprentice' is presented as a steward of these mysteries, tasked with applying spiritual principles (symbolized by the Apron and Plumb-Line) to build an 'inner Temple' and achieve a 'true Holy Empire' of the Divine over the Human.",
