  "central_thesis": "This article proposes a novel interpretation of grimoire-based spirit evocation through the lens of data processing and cybernetics, suggesting that spirits can be understood as 'program shells' within a 'program environment' (e.g., the Lesser Key) and manipulated via 'flowchart magick' for complex, multi-variable magical operations.",

      "chapter_title": "The Goetia Project",
      "summary": "Details a 1989 project by Phil Hine and a colleague to systematically work through traditional grimoires. Initial attempts without traditional ritual structures (circle, triangle) resulted in negative effects (loss of vitality, headaches), leading to the adoption of traditional methods. Observations include the exhilaration of long conjurations, the variable manifestation forms of spirits (often similar to but not exactly matching grimoire descriptions), and the 'conservatism' of LK spirits regarding their operational parameters and comprehension of modern concepts (e.g., computers, digital watches)."

      "chapter_title": "Demons & Data Processing",
      "summary": "Establishes the core analogy by mapping the 'chapters' of COBOL programming (Identification, Environment, Data, Procedure) to the stages of conjuring a spirit. This led to two research threads: creating Chaos Servitors as 'programming language' and explaining the grimoire system (Lesser Key) as a 'program environment', where spirits are 'program shells' processing variables via conjurations as 'fire' commands."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Multi-Variable Magick",
      "summary": "Extends the data-processing analogy to complex magical operations. It proposes 'flowcharting different variables' within an event, assigning specific spirits (servitor-legions) to each variable, and activating the entire system via a 'spirit-executive' (demon-prince). The article recounts an experiment where rigorously flowcharted operations, without formal ritualization, manifested successfully, implying that precise analysis and identification of variables are paramount. This 'program' is described as a cybernetic equivalent to 'Astral Machines' and can be set to lie dormant until conditions manifest. The author suggests translating flowcharts into sigil circuit-diagrams based on Spare's Alphabet of Desire."

    "description": "The 'Flowchart Magick' system, derived from the data-processing analogy, allows for the design and execution of complex, multi-variable magical operations. It involves a rigorous analytical phase to identify all relevant variables in a situation, followed by mapping these variables to specific spirits or servitors. A 'spirit-executive' (e.g., a demon-prince) then orchestrates this 'program' of assigned spirits. The system suggests that the detailed design and analysis phase itself can be highly operative, potentially manifesting results even without explicit ritualization, functioning as a latent 'astral machine' activated by specific conditions.",
