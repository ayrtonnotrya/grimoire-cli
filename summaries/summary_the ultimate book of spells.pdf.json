    {
      "text": "The desire to change and improve that which we have has been around for many thousands of years, if not since man first walked the earth. Magic and spell working have always been a part of that, and indeed still are today. Anyone who practises any form of magic, including spell working, needs to be grounded. This means having both feet firmly planted in reality and also having a basic knowledge of what magic is and is not, what spells can and can’t do and what – with practice – you can do with the tools, information and knowledge you have. This book sets out to give you that information in as succinct a manner as possible.",

    {
      "text": "No definition of magic has ever found universal acceptance, and countless attempts to separate it from religion on the one hand and science on the other, have never been truly successful. What one group of people may label magic, another would label religion, and another science. By choosing only one of these classifications for magic, we close our minds to all the other possibilities that are available to us.",

      "text": "In ancient Pagan communities the elders, or wise ones, had, by their very experience, an awareness of custom and a firm grasp of what had previously worked when trying to gain control over Mother Nature and other powers they did not fully understand. They had access to certain knowledge (and therefore power) that was not readily available to the ordinary individual.",
