It encourages attunement to the vernal equinox as a point of perfect balance, emphasizing themes of rebirth, fertility, purification, and protection.

Rituals are presented as adaptable blueprints, prioritizing clear intent, visualization, and personal connection over rigid adherence.

The system encourages creativity and experimentation within an informed historical and spiritual context, making it a highly operative guide for celebrating the rites of spring.",
