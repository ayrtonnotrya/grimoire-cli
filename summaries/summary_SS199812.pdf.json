It emphasizes the Left-Hand Path of individual godhood, providing both specific techniques for magical development (e.g., conscious visualization, adapted Vajrayana practices, specific Black Magic rules) and broader strategic guidance for its initiates in navigating the mundane and occult worlds.",

It integrates philosophical understanding (Process Philosophy, Ouspensky's psychology) with direct magical applications.

The system emphasizes conscious intent, individual responsibility, and the transformation of the self into a 'Star of Darkness' and eventually an 'ascended Black Master' through the 'Dark Transfiguration.'",
