Core to the practice is the understanding of symbolism, the three-fold law of ritual (motive, method, meaning), and the careful application of intention to interact with elemental, archetypal, and higher-level forces.",

It offers a structured, progressive path emphasizing self-discipline and inner development, contrasting with more sensationalized or purely theoretical works. Its focus on building a personal 'Magical Personality' and integrated practice makes it particularly useful for modern practitioners seeking a holistic approach.",

It also appeals to those with some prior interest in occult literature or psychic experiences, provided they are willing to undertake rigorous self-assessment and disciplined practice, and heed warnings regarding mental and physical health."
