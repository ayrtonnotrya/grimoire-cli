      "chapter_title": "Preface & Introduction",
      "summary": "Details the manual's origin, its focus on the Thoth Tarot, and Lady Shyra's philosophy of Tarot as an \"Art\" distinct from the \"Craft\" (spiritual path) but a tool for self-knowledge. It stresses ethical reading, responsibility, and openness to divine channeling, highlighting the incorporation of Astrology, Numerology, Planetary/Elemental Influences, Hebrew, and symbology for interpretation."

      "chapter_title": "Understanding Your Deck",
      "summary": "Provides guidance on selecting a deck that 'speaks' to the reader, followed by a detailed cleansing and centering ritual using orris root, a dedicated cloth, and meditation to attune the cards. Specific instructions are given for handling and storing the deck to prevent external energetic influence."

      "summary": "Explains the Tarot's division into 22 Major Arcana (Trumps, representing spiritual progression and inner persona, linked to Qabbalah) and 56 Minor Arcana (representing physical/material life, divided into four suits with Court Cards). Each suit and card is assigned complex attributes including Elemental Rulership, a facet of daily life, Astrological Correspondents (Zodiac, Decans), and a Tetragrammaton Letter."

      "summary": "Details how numerical values are assigned to Major Arcana (0-21 Roman), Minor Arcana (face value 2-10), Aces (5), Princesses (7), and other Court Cards (4). Introduces Numerological Correspondents (clarifying card essence, often reduced to 1-9, with '10' as '10/1') and Astrological Correspondents (Zodiac signs, planets, elements), noting that while helpful, deep knowledge in these areas is not strictly necessary for basic interpretation."

      "chapter_title": "Card Placements: Dignified vs. Ill-Dignified",
      "summary": "Establishes the core interpretive duality: 'Dignified' (upright) cards represent positive aspects, while 'Ill-Dignified' (reversed) cards indicate negative aspects, the hidden self, or time delays. The author cautions against labeling cards as inherently 'good' or 'bad,' even for cards like The Devil, Death, and The Tower, which can have positive, transformative effects."

      "chapter_title": "Choosing a Significator",
      "summary": "Outlines various methods for selecting a Significator (a card representing the querent), with the author's preferred method being to allow the Tarot itself to choose based on the querent's personality traits and inner vibrations, rather than physical appearance. A ritualistic process involving shuffling, cutting into stacks, and sensing energy is described."

      "summary": "Distinguishes between 'Spiritual Readings' (using only Major Arcana for personal growth, past lives, and 'Psychotarotology') and 'Mundane Readings' (using all 78 cards for practical, day-to-day issues). The text describes multiple layouts, including the Sixteen Card Spread, Seven Card Ellipse Spread, Astrological Spread, Cabalistic Spread, Celtic Cross Spread, Clarification Spread, Daily Spread, Planetary Answering Spread, and Thoth Spread, providing instructions for their use and interpretation."

      "chapter_title": "General Interpretive Notes",
      "summary": "Offers additional interpretive layers based on card combinations (e.g., multiple Aces indicating significant power) and majorities of certain card types (e.g., a majority of Wands suggesting energy/conflict, Trumps indicating higher forces/karma, or Court Cards implying social interactions). These majorities refine the essence of the reading."

This section forms the bulk of the manual's practical guidance."

    "description": "Lady Shyra's system for Thoth Tarot reading is a multi-layered, correspondence-based approach designed for both predictive divination and profound self-actualization. It mandates a preparatory ritual for attuning the deck, an ethical framework for interpretation, and a systematic method for selecting a significator based on the querent's inner disposition. Interpretations are derived from a card's elemental, planetary, astrological, numerological, and Qabalistic associations, viewed through the lens of 'Dignified' (upright) and 'Ill-Dignified' (reversed) aspects. The system offers various spread layouts tailored for spiritual or mundane inquiries, supplemented by insights from card combinations and majorities.",
