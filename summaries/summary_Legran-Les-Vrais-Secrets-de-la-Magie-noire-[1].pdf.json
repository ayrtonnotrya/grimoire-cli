  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system is primarily a grimoire-based evocation and folk magic tradition. It involves calling upon infernal spirits, particularly Lucifuge Rofocale and his subordinates, through elaborate conjurations and grand appellations. The core mechanics rely on the supposed authority granted by the 'Clavicule' and specific divine/demonic names to compel spirits into pacts, where they agree to fulfill desires in exchange for offerings or future service. Beyond evocation, it details a vast array of practical applications from divination with a magical mirror to crafting talismans, performing counter-spells, and executing various folk remedies and curses using specific timing (lunar, planetary), material components (animal parts, herbs, metals), and verbal formulas.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant as a historical artifact within Western Esotericism, particularly for understanding the evolution and popular dissemination of grimoire traditions. It represents a compilation that made complex Solomonic-style magic, combined with folk practices, accessible to a broader audience. While its ethical framework (promising 'no harm' but engaging with infernal entities for personal gain) deviates from modern ethical magic, it provides crucial insight into the practical motivations and metaphysical assumptions of popular occultism during its time. It also illustrates the syncretic nature of magic, blending high ceremonial evocation with low folk remedies.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience consists of individuals seeking direct, practical, and often immediate results through magical means. This includes magicians interested in grimoire traditions and Solomonic evocation, individuals looking to solve personal problems (love, wealth, health, protection), or those desiring power over others, curses, or revenge. The emphasis on pact-making and compelling spirits suggests an audience willing to engage with infernal entities, but also reassured by promises of safety and control over these forces."
