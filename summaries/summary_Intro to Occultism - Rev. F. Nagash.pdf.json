    "relevance": "This document is highly relevant as a foundational text for anyone approaching occultism, especially given the proliferation of misinformation online. It addresses core definitional issues, ethical considerations, and practical advice for discerning reliable sources, which remains a crucial challenge in esotericism.

Its emphasis on self-knowledge and responsible practice aligns with the deeper, transformative goals of many esoteric traditions.",
