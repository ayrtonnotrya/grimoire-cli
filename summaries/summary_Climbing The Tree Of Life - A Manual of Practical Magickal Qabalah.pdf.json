Its emphasis on practical techniques, from meditations and rituals to talismanic work and daily life integration, makes it a valuable operative manual for practitioners. The technical depth, including Gematria, Notariqon, Temurah, and detailed Sephira attributions, combined with the author's own modifications to established rituals (like the Middle Pillar), marks it as a significant contribution to modern Qabalistic practice.",
