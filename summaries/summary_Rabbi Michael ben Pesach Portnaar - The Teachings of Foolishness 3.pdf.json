  "central_thesis": "The central thesis is that the teachings of Jeshua, particularly those found in \"Mataj\" (Matthew), are not literal historical accounts but profound allegories for an internal Lurian Kabbalistic process of self-transformation. This process involves transcending the egoic 'wish to receive for oneself' and aligning with the 'wish to give' (represented by Jeshua) to achieve true spiritual 'shalom' (peace) and direct connection to the Creator. The work emphasizes a radical internal purification, requiring the individual to dismantle deep-seated attachments, human traditions, and the 'klipot' (impure forces) within their own 'partzuf' (spiritual structure) to allow the 'spirit of the Father' to operate through them.",
  "structure_content": [
    {
      "chapter_title": "The holy message according Mataj verse 10 Part 2 (Verse 11: Seek the Worthy)",
      "summary": "This section reinterprets Jeshua's command to 'seek them who are worthy.' 'Worthy' (laze) is numerically equated to 42, signifying the 'mochin of the gadlut' – the advanced spiritual lights or consciousness. The 'twelve students' (disciples) are understood as internal spiritual strengths deployed to lower 'steps' (spiritual levels) to identify and awaken aspects of the self (or other beings) that are 'worthy' of receiving the divine message, meaning they possess an inherent readiness or affinity for spiritual ascent. The process is vertical, bringing higher spiritual energies down, necessitating a pure receptive vessel free from the 'wish to receive for themselves.' It stresses that 'Israel' represents the higher spiritual states (kether and chochmah) from which 'chasadim' (loving-kindness) originate."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 12: Ask for Peace Over Them",
      "summary": "The instruction to 'ask for peace' (shalom) upon entering a house is interpreted esoterically. Instead of passively giving peace, one actively 'asks for shalom,' signifying a desire to receive the 'higher' spiritual energy. Shalom is understood as originating from above, mediated through the 'middle line' of the Tree of Life. True shalom is only attainable when the recipient possesses 'faith' and a receptive 'kli' (vessel). Jeshua's 'sword' is metaphorically explained as the internal force that cuts through the egoic 'wish to receive,' enabling the individual to rise above self-serving desires and connect with genuine shalom."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 13: If Worthy, Peace Remains; If Not, Peace Returns",
      "summary": "The 'house' is defined as representing the 'four phases' of a 'partzuf' or spiritual structure. If these internal phases are 'worthy' (aligned with divine will), shalom (divine light) will settle upon them. If not worthy (i.e., operating from the 'wish to receive for oneself'), the peace returns to its source, following the 'tikun' (correction) rule that light departs from vessels receiving solely for self-gratification. This emphasizes that man's inherent 'wish to receive' lacks peace, which must be attracted from the 'wish to give' (Jeshua/Creator). This teaching highlights the internal spiritual dynamics of attraction and repulsion of divine light based on the purity of intention."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 14: Shake the Dust From Your Feet",
      "summary": "This verse is a direct instruction for spiritual purification. The 'house' or 'city' represents lower, ego-driven spiritual qualities or states. The 'feet' symbolize the 'partzuf malchut' – the lowest, most external aspect of one's spiritual being, specifically the Malchut of Asiah. When encountering internal states or external influences (persons) that are dominated by the 'wish to receive for oneself' and reject the divine message, one must 'leave' them and 'shake the dust from your feet.' This act is an internal cleansing, preventing the contamination of one's own Malchut from the impurity of egoic reception. It mandates a clear choice between spiritual ascent and descent, emphasizing the necessity of preserving the purity of one's 'kli.'"
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 15: Sodom and Amorah Judgment",
      "summary": "The author interprets the judgment on Sodom and Amorah as a lesser suffering compared to the internal 'fire and flames' experienced by those who reject the message of the 'kingdom of heavens.' Sodom's destruction was external and finite, but refusing the spiritual message leads to a perpetual, internal 'war' and 'unrest' within the self, preventing true shalom. This highlights the severe, self-inflicted spiritual consequences of remaining disconnected from the divine 'wish to give' (Jeshua), implying a state of continuous internal torment more profound than external cataclysms."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 16: Sheep Among Wolves; Smart as Snakes, Simple as Pigeons",
      "summary": "This verse provides a blueprint for navigating internal spiritual conflicts. The 'sheep' represent the 'wish to give' (which is often weaker within man), while 'wolves' symbolize the powerful 'wish to receive for oneself.' The 'twelve disciples' are internal strengths guiding this transformation. To operate effectively, one must be 'smart as snakes' (employing intellect/chochmah from the 'left line' to avoid egoic seduction) and 'simple as pigeons' (cultivating purity, connection to the Creator, and the 'wish to give' from the 'right line'/chasadim). This dual approach maintains simplicity and spiritual focus while shrewdly counteracting the ego's predatory instincts, aiming to transform internal 'wolves' into 'sheep' rather than succumbing to them."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 17: Delivered to Sanhedrin, Scourged in Synagogues",
      "summary": "The author interprets this internally, where 'sons of Adam' (ego-driven individuals or aspects of self) deliver one to the 'Sanhedrin' (high court) and 'synagogues' (traditional, egoic thinking). These represent internal 'klipot' – impure forces, human traditions, and externalized religious dogmas that attack and attempt to subjugate the individual's 'own way' (the true path of the Creator/Jeshua). The teaching emphasizes the need for 'resistance' against these internal attacks to purify one's 'kelim' (vessels) and achieve shalom. It critiques clinging to external 'rabbis' or inherited traditions, advocating instead for direct connection to 'the real source, the wish to give, and that's Jeshua.'"
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 18: Brought Before Rulers and Kings",
      "summary": "This refers to facing and overcoming the internal 'klipot' (impure strengths) that manifest as 'rulers and kings.' These obstacles arise during spiritual work, particularly when attempting to 'ascend ma'n to me the kli kether' (raise lower energies to the highest spiritual vessel). Overcoming these internal 'rulipots' is depicted as an unavoidable step toward spiritual liberation, requiring endurance and perseverance through various internal spiritual worlds (Asiah, Yetsirah, Briah) until one reaches the 'malchut of the world atzilut' to achieve spiritual purification and build the divine 'Name' within."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 19 & 20: Don't Worry What to Say; The Spirit of Your Father Speaks Through You",
      "summary": "These verses highlight the principle of divine reliance in spiritual work. When confronting internal 'rulers and kings' (klipot), the practitioner is instructed not to rely on personal intellect or preparation for 'what to say' but to 'trust the moment' and allow the 'spirit of your Father' to speak through them. This signifies a 'zivug' (coupling) with divine strength, enabling appropriate responses to attacks. The 'Father's spirit' is accessed through connection to Jeshua, indicating that true spiritual expression and action are not intellectual but emanate directly from this divine alignment, purifying the individual's 'kelim' and allowing the Creator to manifest through their being."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Verse 21: Brother Delivers Brother, Father Delivers Son to Death",
      "summary": "This radical reinterpretation calls for the 'killing' of the deepest internal attachments ('brother,' 'father,' 'son' representing kindred and emotional ties) not literally, but from within the heart. These strong egoic connections, rooted in the 'wish to receive,' are seen as separating the individual from 'Jeshua' and the 'source of life.' True spiritual freedom requires dismantling these internal bonds and freeing the heart from clinging to them. Jeshua's own example of prioritizing his 'Father in heaven' over earthly family is cited as the model for this internal detachment, emphasizing that the 'true freedom' of the soul comes from severing these egoic ties."

The core 'operative' mechanics involve constant internal vigilance, discerning between the 'wish to receive for oneself' and the 'wish to give,' and consciously severing deep-seated emotional and traditional ties that bind the soul to lower, self-serving states.

      "text": "11 and every town and village you enter seek for them who are worthy and stay there till you are ready: This is the regular translation but look what is hidden. He says ‘every town and village you enter look for them who are worthy for it'. What does it means 'look for them who are worthy for it'? No matter the place you come, first seek for them who are worthy. We see the Hebrew word lazeh – it, he who is worthy it. Someone has to be worthy to go everywhere because they go to a lower step. Here in Brit Chadasha Jeshua is talking about going to......meaning from a higher step to a lower step. The message is 'go vertical' meaning bring the message of the kingdom of heavens from above to below. This has to be done vertical not horizontal. Only horizontal wouldn't have sense. They have to go to every town and village and there is a lot to say but it would too much. What counts is that when they descend to a lower step they have to find someone who is worthy. What are we learning here in kabbalah? If a higher step goes to a lower step, the higher comes with his back to the lower. Who is the one who meets the higher step? Who is the one he's supposing to meet? What is the meetingpoint? Who is in agreement with the qualities of the meeting point? It has to be someone who is already in agreement, he who connects himself with the higher. Such person is worthy. So if the twelve of you go to another place where they are still ignorant of my name and you announce my name, my kingdom don't go where the wish of the receiving is but go to them who are worthy meaning they who belong spiritual to Israel. Didn't Jeshua say 'first go to Israel'? First search in the lower step for Israel because Israel is worthy in the lower steps....we already learned the higher of any step is Israel – kether and chochmah – this is where the chasadim are. Each step you set in whatever village or town meaning the names of different steps, search for he who is worthy. The holy language is very interesting. Normally the translation would be: he who is worthy that – what is that? Why is Jeshua speaking about him who is worthy that? Pay attention, in the holy language it is written mie hoe hagon lazeh – מי הוא הגון לזה lazeh means to that. In English it is: worthy but let us look more carefully at the word lazeh העלהhtrow for that. It is very interesting; lazeh – he has to be worthy for that. When you count the Hebrew letters you get the numerical value of 42 – worthy is 42 and in Hebrew this is mem'bet - as you remember this is mochin, kether has four letters – the strength of kether are the four letters Hawajah יהוה. The filling of these four letters is chochmah – that makes ten letters. And when we make the filling of the filling we have binah – 28 letters and together it makes 42 letters. This is the holy name 42. We have to go from below to above in 42 steps. There were also 42 stations of the people of Israel in the desert meaning 42 places to rest to come in the land of Israel. Of course we are only discussing spiritual strengths as you already may know. Therefore he says ‘search for him who is worthy the number of 42 meaning who is worthy the mochin of the gadlut, that's the one you have to search for. Another meaning of",

Ask him for shalom, have the desire to receive shalom – have the desire to receive the higher. The strength of shalom is above and it goes via the middle line. Have the desire to receive this therefore it is said ‘ask him for shalom' and not give them shalom. So when you are in the house of another ask him for shalom not giving him shalom. Is he prepared to receive shalom, to receive the higher? Does he have faith? If he has faith he can give you shalom, if not he can't. There is no violence in the spiritual. You can't bring shalom everywhere, didn't Jeshua say 'don't think I have come to bring shalom. I have come to bring the sword'. Sword means that the person has to feel by himself how the sword goes through the wish to receive so he can arise above himself and connect himself with shalom.",

Wherever you go there are four phases then the peace will come over them and if they aren't worthy the peace will return to you. Just as with the light. When the light arrives in the kli of receiving for itself it doesn't enter. There is a tikun rule that counts from the tzimtzum namely if the light goes to a kli but there is only the wish to receive for oneself the light returns to the source. House means four phases and it doesn't matter about which partzuf we are talking about, which strength you see in another person because he only speaks about the inner and not about a person from flesh and blood, so if you meet someone and he has four phases he is ready and he will ask for peace and your peace will come over him. He specific says your peace and not his peace because the four phases don't have peace in itself. You're coming from me and from me the peace will come. From whom comes the peace?

You put your feet in the wish to receive and they don't want to receive from you. What to do? You have something.....if a higher goes to a lower he receives a little bit of the quality of the lower.

They were burned due to the fire and flames from above.

      "text": "16 see I send you just as the sending of sheep between the wolves he says that they are missionary as sheep between the wolves therefore be smart as snakes and simple as pigeon: These are the strengths man needs within him. First: you are the strength to give. In every man there is the wish to give and this strength is much lighter in strength than the wish to receive for oneself. These higher strengths are as sheep. The wish to give is weaker within man therefore the wolves within man are stronger meaning the wish to receive for oneself. What Jews had previously thought? We are sheep and we don't go to the wolves. In their imagination the whole world was full with wolves – the wish to receive for oneself. Once the Jews received the Torah they felt much higher, closer at the Creator. The whole idea is that eventually the wolves; the wish to receive for oneself needs to be penetrated by the wish to give, clear? On its own level the whole creation has to receive the light. Doesn't give the prophet us the symbol of the gmar tikun by saying the sheep and the wolves laid side by side? Each person has his own function and there is no attacking. One is a sheep and another is a wolf and there are more animals that won't attack each other. Spiritual we all have these strengths within us. The whole nature is within man. Within man are the strengths of all the nations in the world. Man was created on the sixth day after the animals. Others too where created therefore man have all the strengths from the animals that were, are and will be. Can you understand this? Man was created after the animal kingdom and as you know there is no disappearance in the spiritual. Which was first created is within man; in every person are the strengths of the animal kingdom. Now you may have more understanding about the words he spoke 'I have send you as sheep between the wolves'. What has to be your behavior as a sheep between the wolves? In the way that you do not fall prey to them meaning don't act as them. Don't let your self be eaten by the wolves and become a sheep wearing the clothes of a wolf. Don't act as the wolves. Behavior gives you the idea of who is who. A Jew, a genuine Hebrew can't be a wolf. If you see a Hebrew acting as a wolf know from within he is a sheep because all Jew are sheep. Their highest sheep is Jeshua, lamb, who surrendered himself for the sake of the Creator to fulfill the wish of the Creator. This is the task for every Jew. In this nation you can see anything because they have learned from all other nations. Rape is definitely not Jews. It is written in the Talmud that when someone from Israel takes another woman and rapes her shake his genealogical tree and you will find a goj. A real Jew will never take another wife and rapes here. They saw the Creator and the Torah was permeated with the Jews spirit. They couldn't.....it doesn't belong to the Jews spirit either to kill someone. War is war but to kill someone because of the killing isn't the quality of Israel but the quality of Esav. A real Jews woman who is a descendant of Sarah never leases her body. It isn't in their nature. They saw the Creator even the maid....If you see something as this shake the tree and you will see he or she doesn't belong to Israel. The destiny for this nation is very high. In a way their destiny is so high, their task is very high and they have to carry it out and have to be sheep forever and aren't allowed to become wolves. They aren't allowed to put on the clothes of a wolf. That's discrepancy to property. If you see this, it is horrible and has nothing to do with the nation of Israel as chosen nation. Here Jeshua teaches us how to stay a sheep when you are Israel. He tells the twelve disciples: you are sent as Israel to the nations of the world that are wolves. Of course everything is spiritual. In every person we see this classification. How to stay true to yourself if you are a sheep in the middle of the wolves? Jeshua gives us a very good advice. He says: ‘be smart as a snake'. On the one hand you have to be a snake meaning use your head and don't let yourself be seduced by wolves. And on the other hand you have to be timim a Hebrew words that comes from the word tame. Avraham, Jakov and Noah where tame: perfection in simplicity. To keep simplicity you have to be very keen. To be straightforward you have to be smart otherwise you will be their prey. Not naïve but stay in high simplicity. Attach yourself to the tree of life, to Jeshua or to the laws of the kingdom of heavens then it will never go wrong. Stay true to the laws of universe....and Jeshua is teaching us how to do this. Be as smart as a snake and on the other hand be as simple as pigeons. What is the meaning of these two sides Jeshua gives us? Two lines, you always have to work in two lines. In the right line you are simple, connected with the Creator, in the state of to give, shalom so you can become as simple as a pigeon. To feel as a pigeon is the right line. A pigeon is a symbol of peace what comes from the Torah. There is peace in the right line. You can compare this with a cow grazing in the meadow, no intelligence, straightforward and simple. In the left line you have to be smart. In the left line there is your I and you have to pay attention in what you are doing. In the left line there is wisdom chochmah and in the right line there is chasadim, simplicity. In the left line there is wisdom therefore you need to pay attention. Attention for what? That you don't receive for yourself otherwise simplicity won't help you and you will be a prey for the wolves. We need to walk beside these two lines just as we walk on two feet, on the one hand be as a pigeon and on the other hand be as a snake. If you do so you will remain resistant against the wolves, against the wish to wish for yourself. Slowly the wolves will do what you are doing and their color will change. The wolves need to change in a nice white coat and not that you become a black sheep. Gradually the will have the wish to give.",

They all hang on his beard. When you are invited to an orthodox family the first thing you see is a picture of some beard, a rabbi who's the rabbi of the rabbi of the rabbi. I had learned with an American rabbi and his table was covered with several pictures of rabbi's. One was a descendant or follower of the other. That's what they espouse and when you come in another house it can be different, they have so many ways. One is Chasidim – Lubavitcher and all of them carry a picture on their hearts. Lubavitcher was a great man. He had a lot of charisma. They sing and dance and shout messiah, messiah.....it's not in my imagination I have been there. They saw the Creator face to face and now they dance around a table, what has this to do with....they wear black clothes just as black wolves. Everything to forces but yet....from within they are as wolves. But deeper in their hearts there is a sheep because from deep within there is Israel and within Israel there is the lamb meaning the wish to give only not developed because they are still within the four phases. Still they cling to a rabbi of flesh and blood instead of clinging to the rabbi who is the messiah. There has never been another rabbi. Know a true Hebrew doesn't cling at another rabbi, doesn't cling at a prophet only the messiah. Don't say for instance 'my teacher is Ari or Shimon bar Yochai or Moshe'. What you can say is 'I feed myself with these different phases'. Cling only to the real source, the wish to give and that's Jeshua. Now you may understand the words Jeshua spoke ‘they will bring you to the court and beat you in their court'. Once again, it is all within one person. What I do is to give you a simple example so it would be easier for you to feel how it is within you. Within yourself there are several areas that attack you and try to bring you to their court. Each area has his own court, his own leader and they all try to beat you because you want to follow you own way. What is your own way? That's the way of the Creator, He had created a special road by way of his thoughts and because of the essence of your soul you want to follow that",

This means there is no need to prepare yourself, don't fix yourself in what will be but trust the moment and go beyond your understanding. I will assure you, it will be given to you what to say. To say has the meaning of what will the strength be. To say is making zivug, which strength you need in that moment to hit the attack and because of that progression. There can't be a true liberation without handing over to the rulers and kings. You need to overcome, there is no other way. In the spiritual work there is only one way – bear it and overcome. You need to experience this world and continue to the next world Asiah the weakest of this world, than continue to the world Yetsirah and the world Briah. There is the left side – the system of the impure strengths. You need to pass them till you come to the malchut of the world atzilut – till you achieve the Name and the Name will purify you, build you up.",

      "text": "20 Because you are not the ones who speak but the spirit of your Father speaks from your mouth: Is it clear for you there is no need to think? The soon you start thinking about the words you want to speak your intellect decides what to say just as a teacher of this world who walks to his bookshelf and takes a book and recites what another person has written down. That's not spiritual! Not what written is in the books is spiritual but what you take in by way of your observance, your kelim.....What attitude do you need so the Creator can speak with your tongue and still make use of your own kelim? That's it. Don't seek in books but let it come from your mouth. Here Jeshua is already speaking of your Father. It was his Father but because they were brought to the judges and for the rulers because of his Name, because they were connected with Jeshua their spirit became the spirit of the Father so you're Father too. We have learned to call the Creator our Father but you need to be connected with Jeshua, there is no other way. Without Jeshua it are empty words, when the strength of Jeshua is missing there will be no connection with the Father either. When there is the connection with Jeshua the connection with the Father is there also and his Father becomes our Father too. Therefore make contact with Jeshua there is no other way.",

      "text": "21 and a brother will deliver his brother for a certain death and a father will deliver his son and the sons will stand upon their fathers and will bring him to death: Is this a message, can you see this as a message? Does he bring here the message of the kingdom of heavens, of peace? Look what he is saying. What do you think is the meaning of his words spiritual? Why doesn't he use the words a man will deliver his neighbor? Someone who is further away than his brother? Why is Jeshua speaking about kindred, about the ones who are so close? Remember Jeshua only came in this world to free man from within, to help him to free himself of all kinds of attachments because that makes of him a slave. The strongest links are with the family. Love your mother, love your father even a simple explanation would help us. Jeshua begins close to home but what is the influence for our soul? Each person has to deliver his brother, deliver his father to death. What does this mean? Brother, father is the deepest place in the heart you connected with. And in this place where your heart is you lease yourself because of the relations....relations of the heart with kindred and because of this man is separated of Jeshua. Because of this man is separated from the source of life. Of course love your father, it is written in the Torah ‘love your father and mother and love your brother' but how? Father, mother and brother they are all as clothing. Of course it is good to have some affinity with them but not more. The reason Jeshua begins with the kindred is because there is the deepest attachment. We already learned.... who was the brother of Avraham? His brother was his cousin Lot who was as his brother. Do you remember? At some point they separated from each other. Lot went to live between the evildoers and Avraham went to another place. There was a spiritual separation between Avraham and his partner – his evil inclination. In this way man is attached with his brother. There are so many links between them who are so near to you. Jeshua also says the biggest enemy is within your house, in your family. Why? Don't take this literally but you have to know when man attaches himself to someone who belongs to his family he takes away the strength to become a free man. The Jews people are a good example, they love their family. For them this is a very good sign, the highest ideal for a Jews man is to be a good man, a good father because the honor of the family is very important for him. And what does Jeshua say? He says – NO. Of course you have to take care for them, do things for them but not cling at your family! Once again and I can't say this enough, everything is within one being, if I speak about family ties I talk about clothing, embedding but you have to be free of whatever clothing or embedding. Free yourself of all the ties that's what Jeshua says to us ‘bring your brother, your father to death' meaning free your heart. The killing has to be from within your heart, the connections has to be killed within your heart only that gives freedom – the true freedom.",

    "relevance": "This work is profoundly relevant to advanced students and practitioners of Lurian Kabbalah, offering a unique esoteric bridge between Kabbalistic cosmology and New Testament teachings. It positions Jeshua not as a historical figure leading a separate religion, but as an archetypal spiritual force embodying the 'wish to give'—a core Kabbalistic concept—thereby recontextualizing Christian scriptures within a deeply mystical Jewish framework. Its radical reinterpretation of biblical narratives as internal spiritual processes provides a potent lens for personal transformation, challenging conventional religious and occult interpretations that focus on externalized practices or dogmas. The emphasis on dismantling egoic attachments and purifying the internal 'partzuf' aligns with the highest aims of spiritual alchemy and self-realization found in various esoteric traditions.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience consists of advanced students and practitioners of Lurian Kabbalah, scholars of comparative esotericism, and those engaged in mystical theology seeking deeper, non-literal interpretations of religious texts. The text assumes a strong foundational knowledge of Kabbalistic concepts (e.g., partzuf, klipot, sefirot, numerical values, tikun). It is not suitable for beginners in either Kabbalah or Christian theology due to its highly specialized, allegorical, and deconstructive approach to traditional narratives. Its dense, technical language and focus on internal energetic dynamics require a sophisticated esoteric understanding."
