  "central_thesis": "Ancient Jewish discourse, particularly in Late Antiquity, actively engaged with, adopted, transformed, and differentiated astral magic and astrological theories, challenging modern scholarly biases that assume incompatibility between monotheistic theology and such practices. The paper proposes analyzing these phenomena through 'fields of discourse' and 'macroforms' to reveal shared patterns and diverse manifestations of magical practice across religious boundaries.",

      "chapter_title": "Astrology and Magic in Ancient Culture",
      "summary": "This section critically reviews previous academic research on astrology and magic, highlighting scholarly biases and 'preconceived attitudes' that often dismissed these practices, especially in relation to monotheistic traditions. It introduces a new methodological approach, advocating for the study of 'fields of discourse' and 'macroforms' to overcome anachronistic 'singularization' of religious identities and provide a more neutral analysis of ancient cultural phenomena."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Controlling the Cosmic Powers",
      "summary": "Focuses on the *Testament of Solomon* as a key 'macroform' demonstrating the Jewish engagement with controlling cosmic powers, particularly demons and planetary entities. It details how Solomon, through a magic ring and knowledge of 'secret names,' subdues demons and forces them to reveal their zodiacal affiliations. This tradition showcases a monotheistic adaptation of older Egyptian decan melothesy, where the power to control these entities is granted by God, allowing human adepts to perform 'pious work'."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Veneration of Planets",
      "summary": "Explores the practice of planetary veneration within ancient Jewish discourse, primarily through the *Sepher ha-Razīm* (SHR) and *Papyri Graecae Magicae* (PGM). This section challenges the normative view that star cult was forbidden in Judaism, presenting evidence of rituals involving libations, sacrifices (including animals), and direct adjurations to celestial bodies like Helios and Selene. It emphasizes that these texts reveal a complex relationship with planetary divinities, ranging from reverent praise to instrumentalization for magical aims."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Heavenly Journeys",
      "summary": "Discusses the motif of heavenly journeys by religious specialists (e.g., Enoch, Moses, Solomon, Hekhalot mystics, Gnostics) to acquire divine secrets and astrological information. These ascents aimed at gaining knowledge of the cosmic order and understanding (and often subjugating) the celestial opponents (archons/demons) that tried to block the mystic's path. The section highlights shared 'macroforms' of mystical ascent across diverse groups, while noting 'microform' differences in purpose (individual vs. communal salvation) and the nature of angels/archons."

      "term": "Fields of Discourse",
      "definition": "A methodological concept for analyzing religious processes in Late Antiquity by identifying shared fields of interest and conflict arenas, transcending traditional religious boundaries. It acknowledges the 'hybrid,' fleeting, and dynamic nature of religious categories like 'Judaism' or 'Christianity' in antiquity."

      "term": "Macroforms",

      "term": "Microforms",
      "definition": "Concrete manifestations of shared fields of discourse (macroforms), revealing the specific transformations, adaptations, and polemical differentiations within pluralistic religious environments. These are the specific texts and rituals that embody the broader macroform."

    {
      "term": "Stoicheia",
      "definition": "Heavenly bodies, planets, or evil entities. In Late Antiquity, they were considered prominent actors in Jewish and Christian theology, understood as cosmic powers (e.g., 'rulers of this world of darkness') that could be controlled or subjugated through magical means."

      "term": "Doctrine of Correspondences",
      "definition": "The fundamental principle underlying ancient astrology and magic, asserting an intrinsic connection and mirroring relationship between various layers of reality (e.g., heavenly realms and mundane events). This doctrine is the 'backbone' of astrological hermeneutics and allows for ritual interaction with cosmic forces."

      "term": "Decan Melothesy",
      "definition": "A system of correspondence between the 36 decans (divisions of the zodiac) and parts of the human body. Originating from Egyptian traditions, decans were sometimes viewed as healing powers, and at other times demonized as entities causing illness, particularly in Jewish and Gnostic contexts."

    "description": "The paper analyzes three historical macroforms of astral magical practice, drawing from texts like the *Testament of Solomon*, *Sepher ha-Razīm*, and *Papyri Graecae Magicae*. These systems operate on the principle of the 'doctrine of correspondences' and aim to control cosmic powers, venerate planetary divinities, or achieve esoteric knowledge through heavenly journeys. The practices involve invoking or adjuring celestial and demonic entities, often leveraging their zodiacal or planetary affiliations, and performing specific rituals to achieve desired outcomes such as healing, protection, obtaining knowledge, or compelling love.",

Talking of discourses also acknowledges the insight that European history of religion is characterized by a two-fold pluralism-i.e., a transfer between religious traditions on the one hand, and an interference between various cultural systems, such as religion, philosophy, politics, law, art, economy, etc. on the other.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This paper is highly relevant for occultists and esoteric practitioners seeking to understand the historical roots and development of astral magic and its relationship with established religious traditions. It challenges modern 'orthodox' narratives that often isolate magical practices from mainstream religion, revealing a deep syncretism and integration, particularly within ancient Jewish discourse. The methodological framework of 'fields of discourse' offers a sophisticated lens to deconstruct rigid categorical boundaries, providing a nuanced perspective on the historical reality of magical practice and its adaptation across diverse cultural and theological contexts.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes academic scholars of Western Esotericism, Occultism, Ancient Judaism, Early Christianity, History of Religions, and the History of Science. It is also valuable for advanced practitioners and researchers in magic who are interested in the historical and theoretical underpinnings of astral magic, grimoire traditions, and the complex interplay between religion and magic in Late Antiquity."
