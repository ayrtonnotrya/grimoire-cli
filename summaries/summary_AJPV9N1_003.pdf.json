This unit, co-headed by Dr. Adam Rock and Dr. Lance Storm, supervises fourth-year psychology students conducting research in areas such as anomalous healing, ganzfeld, shamanistic journeying, and the sense of being stared at, while also supporting postgraduate studies. Dr. Storm, editor of the AIPR's publications, further strengthens this connection through his supervision in transpersonal psychology at Honours level. The collaboration aims to develop a hub for academic excellence in anomalous phenomena research."

      "summary": "The AIPR announces its inaugural Annual Lecture, scheduled for August. Dr. Jurgen Keil, a prominent psi researcher and former psychology lecturer at the University of Tasmania, will deliver the first lecture. His presentation will focus on recent fieldwork concerning apparent reincarnation cases from Turkey and Asia, proposing a theory of 'anomalous communication' as an explanation, distinct from literal 'past lives'. The event, open to all interested in psi, will be held at Deakin University during the first week of August."

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This President's Note is peripherally relevant to Western Esotericism and Occultism through its discussion of parapsychological phenomena (e.g., psi, shamanistic journeying, anomalous healing, reincarnation), which are often explored within esoteric traditions. However, the text presents these topics from an academic and scientific research perspective, focusing on empirical investigation and psychological frameworks (transpersonal, anomalous psychology) rather than a magical, ritualistic, or philosophical occult approach. It offers a contemporary, institutional viewpoint on the study of experiences that might otherwise be interpreted through esoteric lenses.",
    "target_audience": "The primary audience includes members and supporters of the Australian Institute of Parapsychological Research, academics and students in psychology (particularly those specializing in transpersonal and anomalous psychology), and individuals with a general interest in scientific research into anomalous human experiences and psi phenomena."
