      "summary": "This section describes the operative steps of the ritual. The Priest takes up a ritual dagger or wand and ritually draws an inverted pentagram in the air. Subsequently, while turning to each of the four cardinal directions (North, South, East, West), specific invocations are recited to summon particular elemental or energetic forces. The ritual concludes with the Priest pointing upwards and then downwards, delivering a final statement of power."

In this context, it initiates the ritual's active phase, likely serving as a banishing or opening gesture specific to the ritual's intent, contrasting with the more common upright pentagram for protection or spirit invocation."

These form the core of the chamber's energetic consecration."
