    {
      "chapter_title": "Preface",
      "summary": "The author begins by recounting the tragic suicide of a 12-year-old Wiccan girl, Tempest Smith, highlighting the need for genuine spiritual support and community that goes beyond superficial trends.

    {
      "chapter_title": "Introduction",
      "summary": "Drew introduces the concept of 'Lifers' versus 'Rubs' (fashion-statement Wiccans) and argues for a mature, relational spirituality. He contrasts Wiccan views of the Divine as immanent and unified (male/female) with other religions, emphasizing that the true 'Great Rite' is the union of hearts and souls, not just physical sex. He critiques the 'sterilization' of Wicca by the industry and calls for a return to its fertility and relational roots."

      "summary": "This chapter establishes the Wiccan Rede ('An ye harm none, do what ye will') as the foundational law, linking it to concepts of love and communal interdependence. Drew emphasizes that the true strength of Wicca lies in relationships, drawing parallels to ancient fertility religions where family and community were paramount. He critiques superficial understandings of Wicca and stresses the importance of genuine connection."
    },
    {

      "summary": "Drew traces the historical 'Witch Wars' and their impact on 'sterilizing' Wicca, particularly concerning the debate over tradition, sexual expression, and inclusivity. He argues that the focus shifted from the 'why' of ancient practices to the 'what,' leading to a dilution of the religion's core meaning, especially regarding sexuality and the importance of the couple."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Chapter 3: Coven vs. Couple: Public and Semi-public Organizations",
      "summary": "The author differentiates between covens (private, exclusive) and public organizations, advocating for a structure modeled on family and successful couples. He critiques the often unnatural exclusivity of covens and promotes public and semi-public groups (like groves or 'training covens') as more inclusive and conducive to forming meaningful relationships. The ideal religious structure, for Drew, is the couple and the family unit."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Chapter 4: Wiccan Leaders: Guru, Clergy, or Couple?",
      "summary": "Drew discusses different forms of leadership in Wicca, critiquing the reliance on poorly educated 'gurus' and the superficiality of seeking leadership based on publication or perceived fame. He suggests that true leaders are those who demonstrate success in their chosen field, advocating for couples who embody the principles of Wicca as the most authentic role models, leading by example rather than dictating dogma."

    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Chapter 6: The Magickal Child: Wiccan Rituals vs. Real Life",
      "summary": "Drew defines the 'magickal child' as the essence of life that comes from union, equating it to the fruits of relationships. He argues that rituals should stem from and inform real life, rather than being separate from it. He discusses the importance of intention, sacred theater, and the celebration of life, love, and union, advocating for rituals that are joyful and life-affirming."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Chapter 7: Handfasting and the Couple’s Book of Shadows",
      "summary": "This chapter details the rites of handfasting and their connection to life stages (Maiden/Master, Mother/Father, Crone/Sage). Drew emphasizes the importance of commitment, understanding the 'why' behind the union, and the creation of a shared 'Couple's Book of Shadows' as a living record of their journey. He distinguishes between different types of handfastings, including a 'death promise' and agreements for parting."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Chapter 8: Spellcraft and Rituals for Couples",
      "summary": "Drew reframes 'spellcraft' as personal exploration and decision-making within relationships, distinct from simply using pre-written spells.

    {
      "chapter_title": "Chapter 10: Handpartings: The Bonds That Break",
      "summary": "Drew discusses the dissolution of unions ('handpartings'), framing divorce not as failure but as a necessary transition for finding true love. He outlines three rites of handparting, emphasizing the importance of resolving grievances and parting amicably to allow for future happiness. The focus is on the spiritual and emotional aspects of separation, not just legal dissolution."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Chapter 11: The Rest of the Family: Those Who Have Not Embraced Our Law",
      "summary": "This chapter broadens the scope to consider humanity as an extended family, encouraging Wiccans to lead by example and work towards a better world.
