Instead, it serves as a meta-resource, pointing to numerous other works that *do* describe and teach practical magical systems. It catalogues books that outline ceremonial magic, Qabalistic astrology, tarot meditations, instructions for evoking spirits, Rosicrucian grades, and specific applications of Cabalistic principles to spiritual development.",

    {
      "text": "Cabbalism as a form of thought permeates much seventeenth-century literature; it is as impossible to separate it sharply from other ideas of a particular author as it is to define exactly the particular brand of Platonism he held. By the seventeenth century, cabbalism had become so fused and intermingled with other ways of thinking that we look for it less in defined doctrine and creed than in an attitude toward a question.",

    {
      "text": "The Key to the True Kabbalah treats its subject as a “cosmic language\" linked by sympathetic correspondence to colors, elements, musical notes, etc., as well as analogous influences in the akashic, mental, astral, and material realms. Guidelines for the magical use of one-, two-, three-, and four-letter keys (combinations) conclude the work.",

      "text": "“The Latin copies of Sefer-ha-Raziel in particular shows (sic) a continuation of interest in Hebrew angelology among Christian readers well after the great blooming of such concerns among Rosicrucian authors in 1614-1620” (p. 13). “The angelic doctrine of liber Raziel is taken up by a group of texts called Claves Salomonis, magical texts that in conjunction with al-Magriti's book of Arabic magic, Picatrix, influenced Cornelius Agrippa” (p. 18).",

      "text": "Suares does not consider Kabbalah to be mysticism but rather a science of cosmic energies, though in a hidden code. Suares' thesis rests on the belief that each Hebrew letter 'denotes not only a 'letter' but also a sign, a proof, a symbol and ever a miracle revealing its forgotten ontological origin.'",

      "text": "A history of magic during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance has yet to be written. New discoveries and, above all, new interpretive viewpoints, have made obsolete the few existing syntheses, like those of Lynn Thorndike, Kurt Seligmann, or Emile Grillot de Givry. Any scholar who still relies on these works-especially on the first is by no means better off than would be an anthropologist who relied exclusively on James G. Frazer.",

      "text": "In Cabalistic interest, the [seventeenth] century begins with Robert Fludd whose so-called Mosaicall Philosophy is an amplification of Agrippa's Cabalism. Fludd was, in some respects, akin to Pico, in that he tried to reconcile the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies. His attempt to do this was based upon the identification of the ten spheres of Aristotelian cosmology with the ten Sephiroth, which are obviously Platonic—i.e., Neo-Platonic—in character.",

    "relevance": "This Addenda is highly relevant for anyone studying the historical development and diverse interpretations of Christian Cabala and its broader connections within Western Esotericism. It acts as an invaluable guide to primary sources, secondary scholarship, and key figures, highlighting both academic and practical perspectives. By detailing the contents of works like 'Kabbala denudata' and cataloguing 17th-century texts, it facilitates deeper research into foundational esoteric literature.",
