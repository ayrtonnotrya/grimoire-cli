  "central_thesis": "This book challenges the traditional portrayal of the Enlightenment as a period that saw Europe cast off belief in witchcraft and magic. Instead, it argues for the continued relevance and evolution of these beliefs and practices from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries through to the nineteenth century, examining them from both elite and popular perspectives, and advocating for diverse methodological approaches beyond traditional historical ones to illuminate these subtle renegotiations between cultures.",

      "text": "This book seeks to counter this scholarly tendency, by looking at aspects of the continuation of witchcraft and magic in Europe from the last of the secular and ecclesiastical trials during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, through to the nineteenth century. It will examine the experience of and attitudes towards witchcraft from both above and below, in an age when the beliefs and ‘world view’ of the ‘elite’ and the ‘people’ are often thought to have irrevocably pulled away from one another. It is too crude and misleading to portray the Enlightenment as a period of intellectual and social leaps. It should rather be seen as a period of subtler renegotiation between cultures, and a period when the relationship between private and public beliefs became more problematic and discrete, and therefore more difficult for the historian to detect.",

Men of greater wisdom recognise that many are false but remain convinced that the genuine ones are not few in number. My feeling is that the number of the latter is so limited that, generally speaking, out of 500 who claim to be possessed 20 or 30 really are so.",

  ],
  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant to the study of Western Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic because it directly challenges the commonly accepted narrative of 'disenchantment' during the Enlightenment. It provides extensive evidence, drawn from diverse European regions and using interdisciplinary methods (historical, archaeological, folkloric), to show that magical beliefs and practices persisted, evolved, and were actively engaged with by various social strata. It reframes the Enlightenment not as an end to magic but as a period of complex renegotiation and redefinition of its forms and social functions. It highlights the importance of moving 'beyond the witch trials' chronologically and methodologically.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience includes academic historians specializing in early modern and Enlightenment European history, particularly those interested in social, cultural, and religious history; scholars of Western Esotericism and Occultism; folklorists; and researchers interested in the history of science and popular culture. Its detailed case studies and methodological discussions also make it valuable for advanced students and practitioners who seek a deeper, nuanced understanding of historical magical systems and their societal contexts, including the evolution of grimoire traditions and counter-magic practices."
