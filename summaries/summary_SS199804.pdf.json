This is achieved through self-study, active participation in the Temple's community (conclaves, pylons), disciplined application of 'Lesser Black Magic' in daily life, and the pursuit of specific initiatory work tailored to individual needs and goals, such as exploring Xem, Runa, Sethian Gnosticism, or Tantric/Kundalini practices. The system encourages independent thought, critical analysis, and the synthesis of knowledge from both occult and mundane experiences.",
