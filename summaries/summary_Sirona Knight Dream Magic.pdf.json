The system is guided by a 'Nine-Point Dream Magic Checklist' and emphasizes astrological and lunar timing (moon phases, sabbats, days of the week). Practitioners establish a sacred space using both physical and 'astral' altars, consecrate tools, and utilize a wide array of components—including candles, essential oils, herbs, crystals, and magical symbols—to direct energetic patterns into their dreams. Active visualization, chanting, and interaction with 'Dream Guardians' and power animals are key to influencing the dream environment and achieving specific magical objectives.",
