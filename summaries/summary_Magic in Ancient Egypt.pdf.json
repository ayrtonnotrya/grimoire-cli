The system aims to protect, heal, ensure fertility, and in some cases, harm, operating for individuals, communities, and the state. It involves a rich array of ritual actions and symbolic tools, frequently drawing power from mythical narratives and divine names to influence cosmic and earthly events.",

The book serves as an excellent scholarly resource for contextualizing ancient magic.",
