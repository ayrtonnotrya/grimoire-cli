A core philosophical tenet is 'Freshness Counts,' which mandates constant innovation and non-repetitive practice to prevent magical stagnation. The system is designed to empower practitioners with versatile tools for both offensive (via manifestation) and defensive magic, grounded in a belief in inherent cosmic laws supporting protection.",
