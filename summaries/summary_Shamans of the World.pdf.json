    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant for esotericists, occultists, and practitioners of magic by providing rich cross-cultural insights into operative magic, altered states of consciousness, spirit communication, and diverse healing paradigms. It broadens the understanding of 'magic' beyond Western traditions, highlighting universal principles like focused intention, energy manipulation, visionary journeys, and profound spiritual connection. The first-person accounts serve as valuable anthropological data for comparative magical studies, illustrating varied ontologies and epistemologies of non-Western magical systems and emphasizing the deeply embedded cultural context of these practices.",
    "target_audience": "Academics and researchers in anthropology, religious studies, and comparative esotericism; practitioners of various magical and healing arts; individuals seeking a deeper understanding of global spiritual traditions; and those disillusioned with conventional medicine seeking alternative perspectives on healing and well-being."
