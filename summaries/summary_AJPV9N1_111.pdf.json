It proposes hypotheses for first- and second-hexagram hitting rates across Wing's (experimental) and control methods (Hazel's, and top-down recording for both). It also outlines hypotheses for inter-rater reliability and bias in judges' HDF ratings, and for selection and outcome biases within the HDF itself."

Statistical analysis methods (SPSS, VassarStats) are noted, using pooled data from six I Ching studies (N=793)."

      "chapter_title": "Results",
      "summary": "Presents statistical findings: judges' SDS and UIT scores were not significantly extreme. Wing's Method for first-hexagram hitting showed a near-significant 26.2% hit rate (p=.223) in pooled data, with one study significant and one marginally significant. Control methods yielded no significant first-hexagram hits above MCE. For second-hexagram hitting, Wing's Method was non-significant, but Hazel's Method for first-hexagram missers showed a significant 31.1% hit rate (p=.003) for pooled data. The overall hit rate for the experimental method was 14% significant/marginally significant across 22 tests, compared to 4.5% for 66 control tests. No inter-rater reliability was found between judges' HDF ratings (r=-.05, p=.341), though their mean ratings differed significantly (81.98% vs. 59.92%, p<.001). A significant selection bias was found in HDF descriptor-pair preferences (chi-square p<.001), but no outcome biases for first- or second-hexagrams were detected (chi-square p=.919 and p=.357, respectively)."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Discussion",
      "summary": "Interprets results, suggesting Wing's Method is more consistent, implying validity for eliciting I Ching effects, although Hazel's method showed a significant hit rate for one subgroup. The lack of inter-rater reliability for the HDF suggests potential issues with its construct validity, possibly due to differing cognitive styles (abstract vs. concrete thinking) between judges. Despite this, the HDF is deemed suitable for parapsychological research as psi effects were demonstrated. A significant selection bias among participants for HDF descriptor-pairs was observed, attributed to normal psychological preferences (e.g., seeking advice when stressed), while hexagram outcomes showed no paranormal biases."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Conclusion",
      "summary": "Acknowledges the importance of pre-study parametric testing. Concludes that Wing's method of I Ching coin-throwing is consistent and reliable. Despite the HDF's lack of inter-rater reliability, the cumulative record shows consistent above-chance hexagram hit rates primarily generated by Wing's Method, validating its suitability for parapsychological research and suggesting it facilitates psi. Suggests refinement of the HDF could lead to greater results."

The practical mechanics revolve around a subjectively-driven selection process (based on 'feeling states') linked to an objectively verifiable outcome (hexagram generation). The goal is to detect if participants' pre-selections paranormaly 'hit' the generated hexagrams, thus suggesting an operative psi influence in the divinatory process.",

    "relevance": "This work is highly relevant to Western Esotericism and Occultism as it rigorously attempts to empirically validate a classical divinatory system, the I Ching, using parapsychological methods. It directly addresses questions about the 'operative' nature of divination, examining if anomalous effects (psi, synchronicity) contribute to its perceived accuracy or 'meaningfulness.' The study's focus on method reliability and instrument validity (HDF) provides a scientific framework for understanding phenomena often relegated to subjective experience within occult traditions, offering a rare bridge between quantitative research and esoteric practice. It contributes to understanding how a divinatory tool might function beyond mere chance, which is a core concern for magicians and occultists.",

Practitioners of the I Ching or other divinatory systems interested in empirical validation of their practices. Scholars of esotericism and occultism who seek to understand the intersection of traditional practices with scientific inquiry into anomalous phenomena, particularly those concerned with the methodology of testing subtle effects."
