    "relevance": "The Lesser Key of Solomon is highly relevant in Western Esotericism as one of the most influential and widely studied grimoires. It forms a foundational text for many modern ceremonial magic traditions, particularly those involving demonology (Goetia). Its detailed instructions for spirit evocation, sigil creation, and ritual preparation have shaped subsequent magical systems and remain a practical guide for practitioners seeking direct experience with various spiritual entities. It offers insight into the historical development of Solomonic magic and the syncretic nature of occult traditions.",
    "target_audience": "The text is primarily aimed at advanced students and practitioners of ceremonial magic, particularly those interested in Solomonic grimoire traditions, demonology, and angel magic. Its complex rituals, extensive lists of spirits, and specific astrological timing requirements necessitate a dedicated and knowledgeable individual with a strong foundation in occult philosophy and practice. It is not suitable for beginners due to the inherent dangers and complexities described, and the need for significant preparation and understanding to avoid 'temptations of Sathan' or 'unclean spirits.'"
