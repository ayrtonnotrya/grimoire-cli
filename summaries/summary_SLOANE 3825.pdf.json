  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system is a highly structured form of ceremonial magic, predicated on the magician's perceived divine authority to compel various classes of spirits. It involves meticulous preparation, including periods of ritual purity (fasting, prayer, ablutions), careful construction and consecration of magical tools (circles, triangles, lamens, wands), and precise timing based on astrological considerations (planetary hours and days). Operations typically involve drawing specific seals or characters of the desired spirit, reciting lengthy conjurations and orations using powerful Divine Names, and maintaining strict protective boundaries to ensure safety and control over the summoned entity. The ultimate goals range from obtaining hidden knowledge and wealth to performing specific tasks, influencing emotions, or gaining insights from the spirits.",

    "relevance": "This 'Treatise on Magic' is a significant historical artifact within Western Esotericism, specifically the Solomonic grimoire tradition. Its compilation of various 'Keys of Solomon' (Goetia, Theurgia Goetia, Ars Paulina, Almadel, Notoria) reflects a crucial period of synthesis and transmission of magical knowledge in early modern Europe. It provides invaluable insight into the cosmology, demonology, angelology, and ritual practices prevalent among occultists of the era, influencing subsequent magical currents from the Golden Dawn to modern Chaos Magic. Its operative focus makes it a foundational text for understanding the practical mechanics of ceremonial magic aimed at spirit conjuration and command.",
    "target_audience": "Historically, the target audience consisted of practitioners of ceremonial magic, court magicians, or scholars seeking esoteric knowledge. In contemporary terms, its audience includes academic researchers of Western Esotericism, practicing occultists following traditional grimoire magic or incorporating Solomonic elements into modern systems, and enthusiasts interested in the historical roots and practical methodologies of magical practice."
