The system integrates personal introspection (e.g., emotional inventory, belief analysis) with external ritual. Lunar cycles dictate optimal timing (waxing for increase, waning for decrease), and planetary days add resonance. Ethical considerations, particularly the Threefold Law, are paramount, prohibiting manipulative or harmful magic.
