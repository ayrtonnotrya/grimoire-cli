  "central_thesis": "The Tarot, particularly the 22 Major Trumps as presented by the Builders of the Adytum (B.O.T.A.), is a practical \"textbook of occult teachings\" and a \"symbolic map of Consciousness\" designed for inner growth and spiritual enlightenment. Its consistent meditative study and precise coloring, in accordance with specific instructions, facilitates the attunement of the subconscious mind to universal Cosmic Principles, leading to expanded states of consciousness and self-realization. The system emphasizes inner development over external phenomena and integrates Tarot with Qabalah to provide a complete understanding of Ageless Wisdom.",
