  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The system presented is a practical, operative form of herbal magic rooted in various folk traditions, notably New Orleans Hoodoo and European witchcraft. It operates on the principle that specific herbs, oils, and incenses possess inherent magical virtues, categorized by their primary intent (e.g., love, power, protection, luck, success). The core mechanics involve the preparation of these botanicals as oils, incenses, teas, powders, or for use in charm bags and effigies (dolls). Ritual efficacy is attained through specific applications such as anointing, burning, bathing, sprinkling, carrying, and precise timing (e.g., planetary hours). Visualization and focused intent are crucial, often combined with other magical tools like candles of specific colors and strategically chosen charm bags. The system also includes warnings for potent 'Twister Herbs' that can inflict or reverse hexes, and ethical admonitions against Black Magick.",
