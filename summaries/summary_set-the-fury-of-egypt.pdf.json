Its emphasis on self-deification, personal gnosis, and the transformative power of chaos aligns perfectly with modern occult trends that prioritize individual spiritual sovereignty and development. The work acts as a practical manual for internal and external alchemical processes, making it a valuable resource for advanced practitioners.",

It also appeals to intermediate occultists seeking to deepen their practical engagement with Egyptian deities and complex magical systems. A foundational understanding of occult concepts is assumed, making it less suitable for absolute beginners without prior study in these areas."
