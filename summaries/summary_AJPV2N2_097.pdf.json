  "central_thesis": "This empirical study investigates reported haunt experiences at a historical site, examining their correlation with perceptual-personality variables and environmental factors. It aims to conceptually replicate previous findings and test the hypothesis that haunt experiences derive from a \"noise-to-signal ratio,\" where psychological factors facilitate the perception of unidentified, probabilistically distributed stimuli, rather than being the direct cause of reported phenomena.",

      "summary": "Summarizes the study's objective to conceptually replicate findings on haunt experiences, perceptual-personality variables, and environmental factors at a historic mansion. Twenty 'experimentally-blind' participants completed psychological measures and visited ten areas, documenting anomalies. Findings show correlations between experiences and Participant Expectation/Traditional Paranormal Beliefs, but no differentiation between Psychological Experiences and Physical Manifestations by psychological factors, nor association with basic environmental features. The study posits a 'noise-to-signal ratio' where perceptual-personality variables facilitate perception of unidentified stimuli."

      "chapter_title": "Introduction",
      "summary": "Discusses the lack of funding for haunt and poltergeist research, advocating for collaboration with television producers for legitimate studies. It highlights the multivariate nature of haunt experiences, emphasizing psychological factors alongside potential physical energies. The paper frames its investigation as a conceptual replication of prior findings on how perceptual-personality variables like Paranormal Belief, Participant Expectation, Transliminality, and Hyperesthesia mediate haunt experiences, and explores the distinction between Psychological Experiences and Physical Manifestations. Additional measures like 'anxiety sensitivity' are introduced."

      "chapter_title": "Method",
      "summary": "Details a convenience sample of 20 participants (70% women, Mage=35.3) for a 'blind' study at the Edwards Place mansion. Eight perceptual-personality questionnaires (e.g., Cognitions About Body and Health Questionnaire, Screening for Somatization Symptoms, Revised Transliminality Scale, Revised Paranormal Belief Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index-11, Synesthesia, Hyperesthesia, Whiteley Index) were administered. Participants then visited ten marked rooms (three target, seven control) for ten minutes each, completing a custom Haunt Experiences Checklist. An independent researcher later assessed environmental/aesthetic features of each room, also blind to haunt reports."

      "summary": "Reports that 65% of participants experienced at least one anomaly. Most experiences involved unpleasant odours, cold sensations, negative emotions, and bodily sensations, with apparitions and physical manifestations being least common. Historically 'active' areas showed significantly more reported experiences than 'inactive' areas. Experients scored significantly higher on Participant Expectation and Traditional Paranormal Beliefs. No statistically significant differences were found between active and inactive rooms based on artwork, temperature, humidity, or air vents. Psychological Experiences and Physical Manifestations were strongly correlated (rho=.86) and not differentially mediated by distinct psychological factors, contrasting previous findings."

      "chapter_title": "Discussion",
      "summary": "Interprets the findings, noting that perceptual-personality variables did not differentially mediate Psychological Experiences vs. Physical Manifestations, contrary to prior work. Participant reports clustered in previously identified 'active' locations, but also occurred in control areas, supporting the probabilistic distribution of stimuli. Strong effects of Participant Expectation and Traditional Paranormal Beliefs on reported experiences were validated, indicating a psychological set influences perception. The study concludes that basic environmental features did not act as context effects, and calls for advanced instrumentation to identify instigating stimuli, suggesting non-sensitive individuals can detect stimuli if strong enough or ambient 'noise' is low."

    "relevance": "This paper is a strong contribution to parapsychological research on haunt experiences, offering an empirical investigation into the psychological and environmental factors influencing such reports. It attempts to build upon and replicate previous findings, particularly concerning the role of individual differences and expectations. From the perspective of Western Esotericism, Occultism, and Magic, the paper's relevance is primarily as an example of a scientific approach that explicitly seeks conventional or unidentified naturalistic explanations for phenomena often attributed to magical or spiritual causes. It proposes that 'haunt experiences' are mediated by perceptual-personality variables and a 'noise-to-signal ratio' of unidentified stimuli, rather than directly by spirits, magical operations, or other occult forces. It does not engage with occult cosmologies or operative magic, but rather aims to deconstruct such experiences into measurable psychological and environmental components.",
    "target_audience": "The target audience includes academic researchers in parapsychology, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and personality psychology, as well as those interested in the scientific study of anomalous experiences or the psychology of belief. It would also be of interest to skeptics or critical investigators of paranormal claims. It is not intended for practitioners of Western Esotericism, Occultism, or Magic seeking practical systems or philosophical insights into magical workings, as it operates entirely outside of those frameworks."
