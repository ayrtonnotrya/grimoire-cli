Key practices include the Particular and General Examens for self-monitoring and amendment, and the 'Discernment of Spirits' to identify divine vs. diabolical influences. The process encourages detachment from temporal goods and desires, leading to a state of 'indifference' that allows for a clearer perception and pursuit of God's will, culminating in 'election' (making choices aligned with divine purpose) and a profound, loving service of God.",
