Texts which have long been counted among the hekhalot are now thought not to belong, for example, THE VISIONS OF EZEKIEL. 2. Magical works, such as THE SWORD OF MOSES and Sefer ha-Razim, are being drawn closer to the hekhalot. 3. Some works are being wholly reconsidered in that they might not be works at all but rather of one genre or another, as, for instance, the Shi'ur Qomah and Sar Torah texts.",

Certainly, the convenient notion of a neat separation between ascent texts and magic texts can no longer be sustained.",

    "relevance": "This work is exceptionally relevant for any scholar, student, or practitioner interested in Jewish mysticism, esotericism, and ancient religious thought. It provides an essential, academically rigorous roadmap to the complex and evolving field of Merkabah and Hekhalot studies.

Its detailed, technical, and critical approach presupposes a foundational understanding of the subject matter or a commitment to rigorous academic engagement. While not a practical manual, practitioners seeking to understand the historical and theoretical underpinnings of Jewish magical and mystical systems would find it invaluable."
