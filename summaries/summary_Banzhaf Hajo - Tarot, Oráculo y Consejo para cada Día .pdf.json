It describes both a simple 'random page' method and a more structured 'hand oracle' method that uses a chiromancy-inspired finger selection on a diagram to guide the user to a specific page number and corresponding Tarot card. Each card's interpretation is divided into six distinct categories: meditation, emotional advice, future prediction, crisis management, daily practical advice, and an affirmation."

    "description": "The book presents a self-contained divinatory system that allows users to consult the Tarot without a physical deck. It acts as an 'oracle book' where answers are derived by randomly opening pages or using a specific 'hand oracle' method. Each Tarot card (illustrated with the Rider-Waite imagery) is presented with a quote and six distinct interpretive sections: a question for meditation, advice for matters of the heart, a predictive outlook, guidance for navigating crises, general daily advice, and an affirming statement. This multi-layered approach provides practical, actionable insights tailored to various aspects of the user's life or query.",
