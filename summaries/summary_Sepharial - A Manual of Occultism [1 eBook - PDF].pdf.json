The author's attempt to bridge ancient wisdom with modern understanding, and his emphasis on the operative side of magic (will, imagination, and practical methods), made it a valuable resource for aspiring practitioners and students seeking an accessible yet deep introduction to a wide range of esoteric practices. It reflects a period of increased popular interest in occult sciences and the desire for structured learning beyond mere superstition.",

The detailed, step-by-step instructions for horoscope calculation, geomantic figure casting, and mesmerism indicate an audience eager for hands-on application and personal exploration of psychic faculties, rather than purely theoretical or historical scholars."
