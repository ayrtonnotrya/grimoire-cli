This system emphasizes 'severe introspection' to 'come face-to-face with the Dæmons that lurk within us all', leading to 'Setian insight' and the development of a 'higher man'. It involves a continuous 'questing journey' of questioning consciousness and affirming one's eternal will. Transgression against conventional norms can serve as a catalyst for these profound experiences, though it carries inherent risks of violent or disturbing outcomes. The ultimate goal is self-creation (Xeper) and the realization of one's unique being beyond mundane limitations.",

It highlights the organization's emphasis on individual gnosis, self-deification, and the exploration of transgressive and chthonic forces. The varied literary forms demonstrate how core Setian tenets (Xeper, Dæmonic confrontation, will, consciousness) are actively engaged with by its members, making it particularly relevant for understanding the psychological and mystical dimensions of Setian initiation and the Left Hand Path.",
