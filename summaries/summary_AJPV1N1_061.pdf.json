  "central_thesis": "This paper surveys the putative phenomenon of psychic detection, that is, the use of psi abilities in criminal investigation. Police attitudes to psychic insights into the solution to a crime, theories of the possible bases of successful psychic detection, and controlled scientific investigation of the efficacy of psychic detection are addressed. Although the empirical literature is not encouraging for the validity of the phenomenon, a constructive suggestion is made for further research.",

      "chapter_title": "Introduction",
      "summary": "The paper introduces psychic detection as the use of paranormal means (psi abilities) to obtain information for criminal investigations when normal avenues fail. It aims to examine the possibility of using extrasensory abilities (psi) in this context, highlighting the social role of psychics and the historical and contemporary claims of their assistance in solving crimes."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Historical Context and Contemporary Practice",
      "summary": "Historically, psychic detection often involved psychometry, where psychometrists would gain information by holding objects. In contemporary cases, clairvoyant visions (waking images or dreams) are predominant. The paper notes the professionalization of psychic detective services, particularly in the USA, and the varying receptiveness of police to unsolicited psychic reports, with most US police services generally not valuing psychic input highly."

    {
      "chapter_title": "Theories of Psychic Detection",
      "summary": "Two main theoretical approaches are discussed: the parapsychological approach, which posits that psychic detection is a direct application of psi abilities (psychometry, telepathy, precognition, retrocognition), and the skeptical approach. The skeptical view attributes apparent successes to normal psychological factors such as rational inference from known facts, common social trends, popular stereotypes, confabulatory memory errors, 'retrofitting' (reinterpreting vague statements after new facts emerge), and potential misrepresentation or fraud by psychics or media."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Scientific Investigation",
      "summary": "The paper critiques the anecdotal nature of popular evidence for psychic detection and reviews controlled scientific investigations. Early studies often had methodological weaknesses, such as experimenter knowledge of the offender. More recent, rigorously designed studies involving multiple psychics and comparison groups (e.g., students, detectives) have generally found no significant difference in accuracy between psychics and control groups, or psychic performance not exceeding chance levels. The study on psychological profiling by psychics also showed poor performance compared to professional profilers and psychologists."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Conclusion and Future Research",
      "summary": "Despite methodological limitations in some studies, the empirical literature consistently suggests that the efficacy of psychic detection is not encouraging, leading to a 'not proven' verdict regarding its validity. However, acknowledging general laboratory evidence for psi, the author suggests further research focusing on the phenomenology of spontaneous cases could generate ideas for more process-oriented investigations."

It rigorously assesses anecdotal claims and empirical studies, highlighting the methodological challenges in scientifically validating such phenomena. Its relevance extends to informing law enforcement about the scientific standing of psychic assistance and to general readers interested in paranormal claims from a research perspective.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience includes academic researchers in parapsychology, psychology, and criminology, as well as law enforcement professionals seeking an evidence-based perspective on psychic contributions to criminal investigations. Individuals with an interest in skepticism and the scientific examination of paranormal phenomena would also find it relevant."
