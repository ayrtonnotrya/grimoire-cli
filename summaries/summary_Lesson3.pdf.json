Firstly, it advocates for a deep, analytical method of studying individual cards by dissecting their esoteric symbolism, artistic components, and historical context ('Taking a Knife to a Card'). Secondly, it provides a framework for active practice through 'spreads' for readings and 'layouts' for study. The 'Dawn Spread' serves as a tangible ritual for daily self-reflection, integrating card interpretations with lived experiences to foster ongoing learning and personal insight. This system encourages a blend of intellectual rigor, intuitive application, and ethical responsibility in practice.",

The legal and insurance discussions are vital for professional viability and building client trust.",
