    "description": "The document outlines a system of 'Greater Black Magic' focused on individual self-creation (Xeper) and the achievement of god-like stature.

The Prince of Darkness (Set) is central to this process, acting as an internal 'thrusting-block' and generator of an 'anti-field' that accelerates the disintegration and reintegration of forms, allowing the magician to influence reality via 'acausal feedback' or 'circularity.'",

    "relevance": "This issue of 'The Scroll of Set' is a crucial primary source for understanding the philosophical, practical, and socio-political landscape of the Temple of Set in 1989. It offers detailed expositions of core Setian doctrines like Xeper, the Law of Antimony, and the nature of Black Magic, integrating them with scientific concepts (Sheldrake's morphic fields, quantum mechanics) and ancient esoteric traditions. Michael Aquino's article provides a definitive, insider perspective on 'authentic Satanism' from the Temple of Set's viewpoint, sharply differentiating it from other contemporary movements and addressing external criticisms. The practical 'Hero's Working' illustrates an operative magical system tailored to individual self-transformation.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience includes active practitioners and initiates of the Temple of Set seeking deeper understanding and practical application of their philosophy. Beyond this, scholars and researchers of Western Esotericism, new religious movements, and modern occultism would find this document invaluable for its articulation of Setian ontology, magical theory, and its engagement with scientific and historical contexts. Individuals interested in the intellectual foundations of contemporary Satanism would also find it highly relevant."
