It attempts to provide a unified framework for interacting with diverse spirit types, ranging from cosmic entities to infernal demons. Its emphasis on operative magic and detailed instructions makes it a practical manual. The commentary highlights the historical evolution of magical texts and the challenges of interpretation, while also introducing a 'cosmic horror' dimension to traditional Goetic evocations.",

The text assumes a certain level of prior knowledge regarding ritual practice and self-discipline, given the explicit warnings about dangers and the complexity of the presented systems."
