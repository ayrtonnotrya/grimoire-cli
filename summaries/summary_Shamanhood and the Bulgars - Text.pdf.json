  "central_thesis": "The central thesis of the book is a rigorous academic refutation of the widespread, often uncritical, application of the term 'shamanism' to the traditional practices of ancient Bulgars and Thracians. The author argues that true 'classical shamanhood' is specific to unstratified hunter-gatherer communities primarily in Siberia and parts of Middle Asia, characterized by unique beliefs, social structures, and ritual mechanics. Conversely, Bulgarian and Thracian folk traditions, while possessing some superficial typological similarities, are rooted in distinct state-based religious ideologies (such as Orphism and Tengriism) with different cosmogonic concepts, priestly classes, and musical-ritual systems, which fundamentally differentiate them from shamanhood.",

      "chapter_title": "ADISTURBING READ FOR ARMCHAIR SHAMAN-LOVERS. Introduction by Prof. Dr. Alexander Fol",
      "summary": "This introductory section emphasizes the problematic nature of applying shamanistic terminology to diverse cultures, particularly those of North America and the Balkans, advocating for a context-specific and methodologically sound approach to studying ethno-cultural memory, rather than 'armchair shaman-loving'."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "PREFACE",
      "summary": "Neykova outlines her research, noting the extensive global literature on shamanhood but critically engaging with attempts to identify shamans among ancient Bulgars and Thracians, asserting these claims as 'scientific anachronism.' She stresses that shamanhood is unique to specific societies and its study requires understanding its distinct ethno-cultural heritage."

    {
      "chapter_title": "SHAMANHOOD/SHAMAN/SM",
      "summary": "This chapter defines 'classical shamanhood' as found in unstratified hunter-gatherer communities of Siberia and parts of Middle Asia. It elaborates on the region's ethnic diversity, low population density, and the core animistic/animatistic beliefs that inform the three-tier vertical structure of the cosmos and the roles of spirits and deities, such as Tengri."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Rites and Concepts",
      "summary": "Details the characteristics of shamans and their practices, including the hereditary nature of the shamanic 'gift,' the physical and mental manifestations of their calling, and their role as mediators between worlds via 'soul journeys.' It describes public and private ceremonies, the invocation of spirit helpers (animal, ancestral, ongon), and the use of stimulants to achieve trance states."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Untugun and the 'Music' of Shamans",
      "summary": "Focuses on the shaman's drum, 'untugun,' as a central ritual object, detailing its construction, symbolic decoration (representing the world tree and cosmic divisions), and its distinction from other drums like the Bulgarian tupan. It analyzes the improvisational, non-strophic, and vocally diverse nature of shamanic songs and sounds."

    {
      "chapter_title": "BACK THROUGH TIME",
      "summary": "This chapter positions the study within the historical and cultural context of the Balkans, arguing against the existence of shamanhood among ancient Thracians and Bulgars. It highlights distinct Thracian belief systems, particularly Orphism, as fundamentally different from Siberian shamanhood."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Perke",
      "summary": "Explores ancient Thracian religion, emphasizing sun worship, megalithic culture, and the development of state-based religious systems like Orphism with a priestly class. It contrasts these organized traditions and their specific musical instruments (aulos, lyre) with the characteristics of shamanhood."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Sound and Ritual Along the Route of the Bulgars",
      "summary": "Critiques the uncritical 'transposition' of shamanic concepts to Bulgarian historical and archaeological findings. It asserts that Proto-Bulgarian beliefs and calendrical rituals demonstrate a distinct ethno-cultural and musical system, not shamanism, contrary to some interpretations."
    },
    {
      "chapter_title": "Tura/Teiri/Tangra: Dues in Actu",
      "summary": "Examines the ancient religion of the Bulgars, identifying it as Tengriism, centered on the Supreme God Tura/Teiri/Tangra. It explores how this deity is manifested in myths, rituals, and sacrifice, particularly in Chuvash and Balkar traditions, and distinguishes it from animistic shamanic beliefs."

      "chapter_title": "On VeshterstvofWitchcraft and Shamanhood: Differences and Possible Parallels",
      "summary": "Compares Bulgarian 'veshterstvo' (witchcraft) and other European folk magical traditions with shamanhood. While noting typological similarities like soul departure and transformation, the author emphasizes that these practices are rooted in indigenous European contexts and differ fundamentally in their underlying ideology and ritual expression from shamanism."

    {
      "term": "Shamanhood (Classical Form)",
      "definition": "A traditional, authentic form of spiritual practice found in unstratified hunter-gatherer communities, primarily in Siberia and Middle Asia. It involves shamans as mediators who journey to other worlds to interact with spirits, often through specific rites, costumes, and vocal techniques, and is deeply embedded in the community's animistic worldview."
    },
    {
      "term": "Shamanism (as a theory)",
      "definition": "A critical term used by the author to denote an overly generalized, structuralist theory of spiritual universality that unscientifically applies 'shamanic' frameworks to diverse cultures, obscuring their unique ethno-cultural and historical specificities."
    },
    {
      "term": "Animism/Animatism",
      "definition": "The core belief in Siberian and Asian spiritual life, positing that all matter, both animate and inanimate, possesses a spirit or life force. The author notes this concept is foundational to shamanhood but is not exclusive to it, existing in various forms globally."

    {
      "term": "Tengriism",
      "definition": "The ancient religion of the Bulgars and other Turkic-Mongol peoples, centered on a Supreme Sky God (Tengri/Tura/Teiri). It is characterized by state-based ideology, hierarchical deities, and calendrical ritual systems distinct from animistic shamanhood."
    },
    {
      "term": "Untugun",
      "definition": "The single-headed frame drum used by Siberian shamans, serving as a ritual object and a 'semantic double' of the shaman. Its decorations often depict cosmic maps, spirit helpers, and celestial bodies, and its sound is crucial for shamanic journeys. It is explicitly contrasted with the Bulgarian 'tupan'."

    {
      "term": "Veshterstvo (Witchcraft)",
      "definition": "Bulgarian traditional folk magical practices involving individuals ('veshteri/veshtitsi') believed to possess 'magic powers.' These figures can heal, divine, transform into animals, and influence natural phenomena. The author argues it is rooted in indigenous European traditions like Thracian Orphism, not shamanism, despite some typological resemblances."
    },
    {
      "term": "Orphism (Thracian)",
      "definition": "An aristocratic religious doctrine of early class Thracian society, deeply intertwined with the status of the king-priest and his divinity. It focuses on the 'mystery of the Cosmic birth,' the sacred marriage of Mother Goddess and Son, and the 'immortality of intellectual energy,' distinct from clan-based shamanhood."
    },
    {
      "term": "Kamlanie",
      "definition": "The ritual act performed by Siberian shamans, typically involving drumming and singing to invoke and interact with spirits. Its musical character is described as highly improvisational, lacking fixed melodic or rhythmic structures, often incorporating animal cries and unintelligible speech, reflecting the shaman's trance and journey."

  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The book describes the operative mechanics of 'classical shamanhood' as practiced in Siberia and parts of Middle Asia, primarily as a counterpoint to the author's main argument. This system is characterized by shamans acting as mediators between the human world and spirit realms, undertaking 'soul journeys' to the Upper or Lower Worlds. It is highly individualized, often hereditary, and deeply integrated into the animistic worldview of unstratified hunter-gatherer communities. The objective is to interact with spirits for various purposes, including healing, guiding the dead, and ensuring community well-being.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book offers high relevance to Western Esotericism and Occultism by providing a meticulously researched comparative ethnological and ethnomusicological study of shamanism. It critically dissects the often-loose application of 'shamanic' frameworks, which is crucial for modern magical practitioners, particularly in Chaos Magic or Neo-Shamanism, seeking to understand the authentic origins and contexts of the systems they draw upon. The detailed analysis of Siberian shamanhood's operative mechanics serves as a precise reference point, while the rigorous distinction from European folk magic (veshterstvo) and state-based traditions (Thracian Orphism, Tengriism) prompts a deeper, more accurate engagement with source material. This work encourages occultists to move beyond superficial typological similarities towards a contextualized understanding of ritual, belief, and altered states of consciousness, refining their conceptual vocabulary and practice.",
    "target_audience": "Academic researchers in ethnology, ethnomusicology, religious studies, and comparative esotericism, especially those focused on indigenous traditions of Siberia, Middle Asia, and the Balkans. Also relevant for practitioners of modern magical traditions (e.g., Chaos Magicians, Neo-Shamans) interested in the historical, cultural, and technical accuracy of cross-cultural magical borrowings and comparative ethno-magical studies."
