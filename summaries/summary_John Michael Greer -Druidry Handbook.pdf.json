It details the influences on Revival Druidry, including pantheism, Latitudinarian Christianity, Freemasonry, and Welsh bardic traditions (e.g., Iolo Morganwg).

The author argues that the spiritual validity of Druidry lies in its present-day relevance and its unique identity, particularly as exemplified by the Reformed Druids of North America (RDNA).

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book is highly relevant for contemporary practitioners of Western Esotericism, particularly those drawn to nature-based spiritualities and non-dogmatic magical systems. Greer's work is significant for its nuanced historical analysis, challenging both uncritical acceptance of Revival Druidry and its outright dismissal by some reconstructionists. By 'performing alchemy' on historical texts, he synthesizes a coherent and workable system that is both deeply rooted in British esoteric traditions and responsive to modern ecological and spiritual needs. His emphasis on experiential practice, personal ethics, and the interconnectedness of inner and outer worlds positions Druidry as a potent path for individual and collective transformation amidst current global crises. The detailed explanations of Nwyfre, elemental correspondences, and the practical application of Ogham make it a valuable resource for understanding the energetic mechanics of this tradition.",
    "target_audience": "The book targets individuals at various stages of interest in Druidry, Paganism, and nature spirituality: from curious beginners ('tentative toe') to dedicated students ('plunging into its depths'). It is particularly suitable for solitary practitioners seeking a structured self-initiation, as well as members or prospective members of the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), for which it serves as a primary textbook. Its practical focus also appeals to those interested in integrating ecological awareness and personal spiritual development into their daily lives, offering alternatives to mainstream religious and materialist paradigms."
