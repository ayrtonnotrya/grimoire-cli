  "practical_system": {
    "description": "The practical system is centered on 'The First 2 Hours' training, which bypasses traditional memorization. It involves an 'Initial Exercise' where the practitioner sequentially examines each card of a Rider-Waite deck, stating aloud 'what you see' in the image, fostering immediate intuitive connection. This intuitive skill is then applied to structured spreads, starting with the Celtic Cross. The method emphasizes continuous practice and trust in 'first hunches' over analytical thought. Later chapters introduce advanced spreads (e.g., Horoscope, Seven Sisters) and integrate numerology for timing, expanding the core intuitive reading skill.",

  "critical_analysis": {
    "relevance": "This book offers a highly accessible and pragmatic entry point into Tarot for beginners, challenging the traditional emphasis on extensive memorization. Its focus on intuition and immediate image interpretation resonates with contemporary approaches to personal development and simplified magical practice. By explicitly using the Rider-Waite deck, a standard in Western esoteric traditions, it grounds its 'revolutionary' method within a recognized framework while democratizing the practice of divination. It directly addresses the common barrier of complexity, making Tarot less of an academic study and more of an experiential art, aligning with a broader trend of making esoteric practices approachable for a wider audience.",
    "target_audience": "The primary target audience is absolute beginners to Tarot who are intimidated by traditional, rule-heavy, and memorization-intensive methods. It appeals to individuals seeking a rapid and intuitive way to engage with divination, those interested in developing their psychic abilities, and individuals who prioritize practical application over detailed theoretical or historical study. It is less suited for advanced occultists seeking deep historical-critical analysis, complex magical theory, or intricate Qabalistic/Hermetic correspondences within the Tarot."
